Your advice - Appointing an attorney,TamsinT,2024-06-05T15:16:36+0100,0,"Do you have any tips for other people with dementia about deciding who to appoint as an attorney through an LPA or similar legal document? 

Perhaps they’re wondering whether the people they have in mind will be able to agree with other, or they might be unsure about how to ask a friend or relative about being appointed as their attorney. 

Maybe they can’t think of anyone suitable at all.

I don’t know how to handle this,Nobo2,2024-06-13T22:41:06+0100,0,"Hi everyone, it’s been just over a year since I last posted about my wife not recognising me at times. So now we have progressed to the point where it can be all day , morning, evening, bits in between every permutation. That in itself is confusing because I do not know at any time who she is seeing me as `husband, Friend, another man. Somebody else impossible to know, so I just carry on as normal.
my biggest dilemma is at night when she doesn’t know who I am, for example she thinks I am the friend and I can go home anytime I don’t have to wait for her husband to arrive. However, what do I do I don’t have anywhere to go and I’ve no way of knowing what she will do if I try to persuade her that I am her husband. 
we live in a flat so it’s not possible to go into another room and reappear as Me husband.
Has anyone else had this if so any pointers on what to do. Please"

Diagnosis how did you deal with it?,vas,2024-02-02T18:42:41+0000,0,"Before Christmas after a scan to check on a presumed stroke I was told verbally by a visitor from the old folks mental heath office that I had Altzhiemers and vascular dementia. I had no consultant letter or face to face appointment. This year I was told I didn't have Altzhiemers. I asked for a letter with the diagnosis. Now this week during a telecon with the consultant I was informed I a had Altzhiemers together with vascular dementia. I was also told Altzhiemers could only be confirmed with a brain biopsy, which obviously, could only happen when the patient is dead.
It was a most unpleasant phone call.
I also found this afternoon my doctor had been informed of the disgnosis the information was shared with my husband without my permission. Its as if, because of the diagnosis, I am no longer a person with rights. No wonder sufferers can get angry.
I think the way both patients and carers are treated is disgraceful."
Early onset Dementia and Pacemaker replacement. I don’t want to do it.,bunnylovevol,2024-04-19T23:54:26+0100,0,"Hello, I am a 60-year-old female who has had a pacemaker for the past 15 years. I just got newly diagnosed with some form of dementia, my guess vascular. I live alone, I have no children, however, I do have older siblings, nieces, and nephews, etc. I was just given this diagnosis recently and also I’m at the point that I have to have my pacemaker battery changed out. I don’t want to do it! I don’t want to live the next 5 to 8 years with dementia, the drain on my family, and the medical system, and on myself. Has anyone else ever run into this situation with a young family member? I would rather live the last couple months of my life, happy and doing things I would like to do and let the pacemaker battery life run out. I’m not asking if whether I should do it or not, I’m just asking if anybody else has had family members go through this? How did you as a family emotionally handle it? How did the person affected with dementia in the early stages handle it? I have to let my doctor know soon. I was scheduled for the procedure before I found out about the new diagnosis of dementia.  

Thank you."
Dementia and Hobbies,KenC,2009-04-15T23:52:50+0100,0,"I find it amazing at times when I see people like myself with dementia who carry on with their hobbies and sometimes start new ones to see if they can master it. I also admire them for this.

Since being diagnosed I have started using a digital cameras which I carry with me on my walks, and it amazing how I have taken to it after using a Canon SLR film camera which had zoom and wide angle lens all in a bag. 

I had to stop using the film camera because I had problems loading the film at times, so the digital camera saves a lot of stress. When I get home I then load them onto my lap top, where I have my own photo album.

I also took up painting again after my diagnosis, and although this is just basic I get a lot of enjoyment from it once I can get started. 

I did start to go to classes, but I found that the teacher was not really interested in novices, and all he wanted to do was give everyone a copy of a certain picture and ask them to copy it. 

This worked well until my last day when he produced a copy of something resembling the ""Scream"", which looks rather frightening to start with. 

Apparently the original was done by someone who had some form of mental problem, but no one seems to know what it was. However after struggling through this piece of work for around half an hour, the teacher came back and took my picture away and started to show it off around the class, which I found a bit disturbing.

 What he then said was, this was one of the best copies he had ever seen which I found embarrassing. 

I did not dare to explain that I had dementia, as no one in the class knew at that time. 

Some time later a lady came up to me and asked why I had stopped going to this class, and I admitted that I had problems with art as I am just a novice. 

She then said that after being told that I had dementia from someone else, she wished that she has spoken to me and made me feel at home. 
She also said that the last piece of work I had done made everyone think that I had been an quite proficient as an artist and not a novice, but she also said that people with dementia actually produce work that sums up what they actually think, without trying too hard.

I have since learnt that many people with dementia take up art as a form of relaxation, and many prove to be excellent at it.

After this I do wonder how many other people with this illness start a new hobby and enjoy it as I did, (Apart from the Scream which went straight in the dust bin when I got home as it scared me to death).

Best Wishes

Ken"
Do we know what our dementia loved ones are thinking?,dcrowex,2024-05-04T13:39:08+0100,0,"I often wonder if there were any studies to determine what our loved ones are actually thinking. I sit with my friend, mostly non verbal, and she stares at the floor or the TV.  If I make a comment, she does not usually respond. She may look at me, but usually not.  So I wonder, does she know what I just said? When I make a comment about a character on TV, does she understand? When I ask her if she needs anything, does she understand what I am asking?  When I mention her tray of food in front of her will get cold and she needs to eat, she just looks at the tray.   I know she hears me but I do not think she can process what I am saying.  She may mumble something and if I ask here what she just said as I didn't hear her, she does not respond or gets irritated.  Anyone else wonder these things?  I read what I can about this but I never see this being addressed.
Best regards to all, Debbie"
Why I hate ‘The Long Goodbye’,WJG,2024-03-23T18:29:16+0000,0,"I loathe the new commercial for the Society ‘The Long Goodbye’. I think that it reinforces every negative stereotype about dementia, and does nothing whatsoever to help people such as myself living with brain disease. It dismays me that the Society has given it its backing.

Bruce Willis of ’Die Hard’ fame shares with me a diagnosis of degenerative brain disease. This commercial is all about telling people that those of us with such conditions not only die hard, but we die many times in advance of our own actual deaths. I prefer to ‘live well’, or as well as I can do. For this, I need help - and I need a change in attitude from the wider community. But this advertisement will only increase stigma, not lessen it.

The new drugs on the horizon will only work for people in the early stages of disease, so we need to convince people that there is value in seeking early diagnosis. No one watching this ad would want to do that.

I call on the Society to recognise that ’The Long Goodbye’ is a mistake, and to withdraw  it."

My mom has had Alzheimer's for roughly 10 years.  She also has an ileostomy pouch. Recently she has what seems to be regurgitating what seems to be either her pills or part of her snacks (only small amount) into her mug or cup of tea. She has also stopped finishing all her tea which is very unlike her.  She takes 5 different pills a day, levothyroxine, clopidogrel, amlodipine, artovastatin and donepezil. We wondered if this was a common problem at whatever stage she is at, as she sleeps a lot during the day but is bright otherwise. As it's only been happening the last few days we haven't spoken to her GP or memory Dr (they are different) yet."

I am angry in the evenings,WilliamEvans,2024-03-30T22:19:24+0000,0,"I AM ANGRY IN THE EVENINGS

William Evans

March 2024​
So, this is about my Dementia, to be specific, Vascular Dementia. I was diagnosed almost a year ago in August of 2023. I have read and watched many things about dementia and found that almost everything is said or written by Drs. or caregivers. I am still skeptical of the diagnosis and I’m hoping the Dr. is wrong.

For all my life I have forgotten names and phone numbers. I have had trouble with remembering steps in tasks that I haven’t done for some time. Things like troubleshooting plumbing problems or structuring a paper I’m writing. But I have always worked it out after a few moments. After my diagnosis my wife and other family members are always watching me and are quick to correct me. This is hard for me to accept. Sometimes I’ll get irritated when questioned about somethings; particularly when I’ve thought through the process or problem and decided on how to proceed.

It's possible that some mental organizational processes are not as sharp as they once were, but I know where I am, what day it is, where I’m going and what I’ll do when I get there. I know what my wife and I did yesterday, the day before, last week and the week before. When I get frustrated and defend myself, I get “the look” and a “okay” which I know is a caregiver response of picking her battles with me.

Am I fading, or are people looking for me to fade and read normative behaviors as Dementia symptoms, which angers me and then I get a “there, there” or “okay”?

Oh yeah, I forgot, I turn 70 this year. Pun intended. I get tired of this by the evening and become angry.

Does anyone else feel this way? Is this part of the process?

William"

Disinhibition,David Joseph,2024-01-21T13:55:26+0000,0,"Dear Forum members,
I thought I knew about disinhibition, but sadly I do not. I have several questions that I can’t find answers to.
I’ve recently started swearing a lot inappropriately, talk a lot when I shouldn’t, talk to strangers on the bus or in shops, and feel I want to do these things at the time. For the last 78 years I never or rarely did so, but in the last year behaving like this has started and worsened!!! God help me.
What does this mean? Aside from memory problems, word finding when talking, not understanding, and unable to find objects round the house when my wife tells me where they are, I’ve been fine otherwise, and feeling better on donepysil. 
Can anyone advise me on what I don’t know? I didn’t expect this!
Should this be happening to me?

Thanks,

David Joseph"

Gradually I am relying more on others to help me carry out the simplest of tasks such as taking medication, shopping, keeping on top of household chores and remembering to make bill payments etc. I struggled to accept that this was real and I'm sure my loved ones also wondered was this self inflicted as I'd struggled with alcohol abuse in the past. I have only recently started to take this condition seriously and am beginning to accept it and the reality that the condition will get worse over time. I would be grateful for any information or advice you could provide me with on self help groups or activities I could enroll in my area, I live in TEDDINGTON SW LONDON and wouldn't mind having to travel a short distance by public transport, any advice will be gratefully received .

what tests can show if your MCI is related to Alzheimers or not?,hopefu1,2024-02-12T13:10:20+0000,0,"I have just been diagnosed with MCI, but the neuropsychologist said she ""thought"" that it was not related to Alzheimers, but mainly a result of my heart bypass surgery in 2016.

From my research I believe I'm seeing that a PET scan, or spinal fluids tests can show DEFINITIVELY whether my MCI is related to Alzheimers, or not.  What does anyone out there know about this?"

Welcome to my world,Norrms,2022-09-22T15:58:35+0100,0,"WELCOME TO MY WORLD OF DEMENTIA
Please, step this way and i will try and show you what it's really like to have dementia.
Oops! Mind your step please, that's what we call spatial awareness, what that means is sometimes you don't always see what's in front of you and tend to miss the steps going up or coming down so be careful. Pardon? You can't see properly? Does it feel like you have net curtains in front of your eyes? Yes, well that's perfectly normal for those with dementia, looking out on life seems so distorted sometimes, just dementia playing tricks on you. Please take a seat, OH OH ! Be careful you nearly missed the seat then, make sure it's right behind you before you sit as it can sometimes seem nearer than you think.
Would you like a drink ? There you go, a nice glass of cool water, sorry? You can't see it? Oh, I am so sorry, what was I thinking? that's because I have put it in a clear glass, here you go, it's in a nice coloured vessel now, is that easier to see? I am so pleased. What? Who's that at the window?? Oh please don't worry, it's probably dementia playing its tricks on you, come on let's go out for a bit of something to eat. Here you are, here's your coat, please don't worry you will find the arms soon, i will help, there you go! It doesn't matter how long it takes we will get there.
There you go, all inside the car, please put your seat belt on, Sorry? Hang on i will get out and put it on for you, it’s a bit of a ***** this dementia aint it? There you go, that's better, off we go.
WHOA!!! That’s the door handle not the window, please don't open that if you can remember, i know its hard. I am so pleased you feel better getting out and about, and i know how much you like watching the world go by, let’s have a drive over the moors before we go to town. Yes, it’s beautiful isn't it? The moors just go on forever, what? You feel as if you can breathe easier and see better out here, well that's wonderful, let’s go and get some lunch in town.
Here we go, wait!! Please wait until i stop the car before you get out and please stay on the pavement till we cross to the cafe. I know you don't like me holding your hand and i know you are not a child but i need to keep you safe,
WHOA!! Phew that was close, you didn't see that car? That why i need to hold onto you, so sorry didn't mean to shout, just frightened for you, come on let's get something to eat. What would you like? What do i think you want? How would i know? You want egg chips and beans, that's wonderful, would you like to order when the waiteress comes? Here she is.
No, he hasn't had a drink and hasn't got a speech impediment thank you, waitress!! He has dementia and mixes his words up sometimes, please don't worry it's not your fault, you don't know what you don't know I will drop some leaflets off. That was quick, here's your lunch, yes that's your knife on the right and fork on the left, don't worry about it. OOOPS missed your mouth? i do that so many times and please don't worry about the spillage, it will wash. No, i am sure the next table isn't looking at you and if they are then they are only curious and uneducated about those of us with dementia. Be careful that tea is hot, should have really got you a cold drink, .
I can see you yawning, are you tired? I know you feel you shouldn't be but it’s what happens, so much going on is bound to take it out of you. Here we go, back in the car now, sorry? You don't know where you are?? That’s ok, you're in your local town centre and we have just had lunch, Yes we really have and you enjoyed it LOL. Yes, i will take you home now, what do you mean you don't live here? You do my friend, come on in and sit down.
Please don't cry it's been such a good day really, believe me, it could have been a lot worse, I know your frightened and frustrated and don't ever think you are on your own, there are millions of us s around the world just like us. Sundowning is horrible, we must try and explain to all what it’s like, its happens most afternoons so I must ask your loved ones/carer to change all your appointments to “AM “so it's easier for you, you are the most important person in all this, and the best thing is try and have a nap for an hour,
Goodbye my friend,
 Till next time"

I was siagnosed with early onset vascular Dementia around 2 years ago... and it has been a roller-coaster of emotions since.
I also live alone.. with friends far away.  And , socially, I don't really want to make any new friends because I have to explain my difficulties..
My therapist also suggested looing at things that game me joy in the past..  Like gardening, etc.. which we've seen as advice everywhere.
 - A recent thing she said, was to challenge myself daily to find joy, and try challenge myself to try again the things I used to enjoy..
For me, that really didn't work out, but I found a non-threatening craft studio where you pay a small fee, and they show you how to do things, and then leave you to quietly take as long as you need.  They always close by if I have questions.

I am not a crafty person, but having the gentle support is great..

Thought I would share...  since it is the only thing that gives me joy right now..  I also enjoy just casual chats with shopping assistants etc."

""Hello

I was just after some advice, I have had some form of dementia for a few years now and found that word puzzles/games  such as cryptic crosswords and scrabble have helped greatly, I have spent some time showing others how to do these and wondered if you knew of any organisations I could approach to work remotely from home in doing this? I was thinking of for instance of one to ones with dementia sufferers and online scrabble to help with memory problems."""
FROM SUCH HUMBL:E BEGINNINGS,Norrms,2023-08-02T10:20:26+0100,0,"WE BEGAN WITH SUCH HUMBLE BEGINNINGS

Hiya, what you see below is certainly not something I ever expected when we launched the Purple Angel dementia campaign ten years ago this November in little old Torquay in front of just 40 wonderful people.. Now recognized in most parts of the world, (over 60+ countries) and thousands of global Purple Angel dementia ambassadors later, and as you will read are now launching in South East Asia on October 6th this year and I have been asked to send a video, as Founder, for one of the opening speech. The words mindblowing and Gobsmacked come to mind but just don't cover it really, but, as my illness continues to get worse I can sleep solid in the Knowledge, that the Purple Angel has spread her wings even further and will continue to do so
NORRMS NC NAMARA


Hiya Norrms
I hope this message finds you well. I am delighted to inform you and your esteemed organization that the official launching of Purple Angel Philippines, along with a conference on dementia with the theme ""Cure and Care: The Future Perspective of Dementia,"" has been confirmed. The event will take place on October 6, 2023, in Cebu City, coinciding with the commemoration of Elderly Filipino Week, observed from October 1 to 7. This momentous occasion marks a significant step in our journey towards creating dementia-friendly communities and fostering a more inclusive society for those affected by dementia. This event holds national importance and will include a focus on the role of music therapy in dementia care, emphasizing its value in helping individuals with difficulty communicating to express themselves and connect with their emotions.

As you know, the Purple Angel Dementia Movement, founded by you in 2013, is a global awareness campaign and initiative aimed at raising awareness and understanding about dementia. Your dedication to advocating for dementia-friendly communities worldwide, promoting empathy, support, and compassion for individuals living with dementia and their caregivers, has been truly inspiring.

The conference objectives include uniting stakeholders from the Philippines and Southeast Asia to collaboratively address dementia challenges. We aim to raise awareness, empower individuals with dementia, highlight the importance of music therapy, promote dementia-friendly practices, and officially launch The Purple Angel Dementia Awareness Campaign. Moreover, we seek to strengthen our presence and collaboration, form a dedicated core group, and advocate for dementia-friendly policies and community support to create a lasting positive impact on dementia care and support in the region.

In light of your instrumental role in the Purple Angel Dementia Movement and its profound impact on dementia awareness and support, we would be deeply honored if you could deliver a speech via video. Your speech could include insights into the movement's origins, especially its beginning in the Philippines, where I was awarded as the first ambassador on March 14, 2019. Additionally, it would be wonderful if you could highlight our first collaboration during the Dementia Care During Covid-19 – A webinar in collaboration with UK Purple Angel on July 18, 2020, which garnered significant attention from individuals across Southeast Asia. Where you speak about the dementia movement in your country.



Thank you for your unwavering dedication to this cause, which has inspired me and many others deeply. Together, let us continue to make a lasting difference in the lives of individuals living with dementia and their caregivers. This is just the beginning, and I am committed to furthering awareness programs for dementia within my region of focus in Southeast Asia.

With warm regards,

Jiil
Head of Operations in Southeast Asia"

People living with dementia have a higher than normal chance of experiencing depression and anxiety, especially if you’ve had depression before.

People living with both dementia and another mental health problem might benefit from talking therapies, including counselling and CBT.

We have a page on the Alzheimer’s Society website detailing ways to manage living with both dementia and a mental health problem. You can read this here.

Secrets and Lies - dementia,Norrms,2023-08-21T10:47:10+0100,0,"SECRETS AND LIES -DEMENTIA
When I was first told I had Dementia I was advised to “Use it or lose it” and sent on my way!! If I had just been diagnosed with Cancer or HIV would they have said the same? What were they holding back? What SECRETS did they hold about this disease? As time went on I realised that not only was there nothing in place for somebody like me aged just 50yrs old with this kind of diagnosis but nobody talked about it openly?? WHY NOT? Was that a SECRET too? All I learned about this awful disease I learned via the computer but here are something’s I had to find out as time went on.
1. Sometimes when I walk into the room and see my Angels face, drawn with worry and trying to figure out the best way forward for the future, what am I supposed to say? Do I say I am sorry? Do I pretend I haven’t seen her? Do I lie to her and say everything will be ok when quite clearly it's not going to be? Nobody told me this would happen!
2. Never having lied to any of my grandchildren, when they ask “Grandad, are you going to die soon?? How do I answer that one? How do I look them in the eye and say “Not to worry, I am not going anywhere “ How do I look at their wonderful innocent faces and tell them that I might not be here to see them grow up, or see them married and have children of their own? Nobody told me this would happen?
3. When my Angel holds me so tight and whispers “What am I going to do without you?” How do I answer her? How do I calm her fears and trepidation? Nobody told me this would happen!
4. The nightmares, the hallucinations, the constant pressure of always being in the wrong, getting nothing right, dates, times, remembering holidays and places I have been!!
WHY DID NOBODY TELL ME THIS WOULD HAPPEN??
ALL THESE SECRETS AND MORE!!!
WHY ARE THESE THINGS NEVER DISCUSSED??
LIES
Well, where do I start??
1. It’s only an Age-related disease? Err excuse me????
2. It’s contagious? Yes, some people really do walk away from me as if I have the Bubonic plague.
3. I don’t LOOK LIKE I have dementia?? Please explain to me “What does somebody “look like “with dementia.
4. It’s no use talking to him/her as she/ he won’t understand you?? Please tell me how do you know that?? When did you pass your degree in matters of the mind?
5. Just dress them in anything, they won’t know ?? Again, how do you know this??
6. A member of my family has a “Touch “of Dementia, that’s just like saying my sister is a “Touch Pregnant!!!
7. Dementia comes on suddenly!! NO IT DOESNT!!!  Its actually a Critical chain of events that leads up to the later stages, it's just all about becoming aware of the signs.
8.  And the biggest one of all, its all about losing YOUR MEMORY!!
NO ITS NOT!!!
It’s about losing your lifestyle skills, your ability to walk properly, to talk properly, to count money and understand the simple tasks of life which you wouldn’t normally give a second thought to. Its about putting the milk in the oven and the hot cup of coffee in the fridge!!
SECRETS AND LIES, EVERY ONE OF THEM, with a lot more besides.
My dear friends, until these secrets and lies are stopped, until the truth comes out about this awful disease and until each and every one of us stand up and shout`s that enough is enough!! We will struggle to overcome something we are in the dark about. No more should we hide in the shadows and whisper about Dementia. No more should those of us who have this disease be looked at as if we have two heads!! And no more should this disease be the Silent Enemy! Because I for one will not go quietly and will campaign long and hard until there are no more SECRETS AND LIES,
ALL WE WANT IS Just ""TRUTH AND HONESTY !!"
Shrinking Independence,Norrms,2022-11-16T10:43:20+0000,0,"SHRINKING INDEPENDENCE

Sometimes I sit and try to think about certain things and the one thing that always pops up and makes me so incredibly sad is trying to remember the last time I went out on my own, anywhere. Now don't get me wrong, I love my wife more than life itself and will never be bored of being in her company, she is so loving and funny, but sometimes, just sometimes I wish I could do the things most do, on my own. You know, take a walk for a morning newspaper, sit on a bench and read some on the way back and watch the world go by, or say to Elaine ""What do you need? I will go and get that, and not to mention the odd pint in the pub, laughing, joking, making friends.
You see when people think about dementia they don't think about things like this, it would never cross their minds that dementia can play such a horrid part in stopping you from living your everyday life and just doing the simple things. Over the years and for the last ten years I have been told I have lost my road sense, if my wife or carer is not with me when I try to cross a road then all hell lets loose as I will walk unknowingly across the road even if there is oncoming traffic or not, just ask the bus drivers at St Marychurch where I live!! As time goes on and each year passes, sadly you become used to it and it becomes a way of life, but deep down, every time you would love to go somewhere on your own and you can`t,  it hits home.

I have become very good at hiding this, you see, people with dementia are so good at hiding things especially when it comes to their feelings, but sometimes it hurts so much. You feel like you’re a burden, an annoyance, and I am sure others feel the same. You have to reshape your days, NO, reshape your life I should say around this and it’s yet another thing added to the problems connected to dementia that nobody ever talks about. Did anybody ever tell you that because the person can’t go out at night because of sundowning your friend's list would shrink, the invites would stop, even the ones for during the day because dementia has raised its ugly head? Or have they ever told you about the incontinence, bed wetting, shouting and screaming at night due to night terrors, loss of reality, times and dates, swearing, and foul moods? How about your spouse of so many years saying they don’t recognise you? No, sadly I suspect not.
 Is there a thing as too much information when it comes to dementia or any other illness? I personally think not, but I do think there is a time and place for everything, and everything should be spoken about at the right time, in stages, as the disease progresses, as it does in other illnesses like cancer and heart problems, so why not dementia. Why is dementia STILL this TABOO subject that is still whispered about in some corners, so very frustrating!!

I do worry about this, I would be lying if I said I don’t, but I worry more about the future, of those to come who will be diagnosed with dementia in the future. Will they still be going through the Stigma we all did in this day and age? I certainly hope not.

Memantine,Defiance,2022-09-08T13:28:07+0100,0,"Hello I have been on memantine now for nearly 4 weeks up to 20mg now and must admit it has been difficult adjusting to the higher doses. But i am finding some benefits, managing to do finances online banking etc, found this very difficult and frustrating before memantine. Feeling more tolerant and happier not becoming aggressive. Hasn't done anything for my short term memory but i can live with that. Waiting for memory clinic to contact me to bring my next months supply of memantine and do some health checks on me. Feeling very pleased with memantine and hope it will keep me as I am for some time to come."

Dementia and the shadow man,Norrms,2023-08-11T08:38:12+0100,0,"THE SHADOW MAN
You can follow me about all day, but you can’t scare me,  IVE GOT KIDS!!! I Shouted!!  Elaine came running in from the garden asking “Who are you talking too? Nobody, I answered, as I didn’t want to worry her, but she knew, oh yes she knew, she had that look on her face that said Uh oh, he is here again, THE SHADOWMAN as we call him, and he was. I can never catch a look at him fully as he hides in the shadows and follows me around, all day sometimes. His real name of course is Dementia, but because I know he`s there, watching, mocking, laughing at me I/ we  have given him this name to try (Unsuccessfully I may add) to humanise him.
Elaine says I sit in my chair, my eyes darting from side to side, sometimes turning around quickly or jumping out of my skin. Sometimes he comes from absolutely nowhere and scream’s as if the devil himself is after him, or maybe he is the devil? Now there’s a thought? Apparently, sometimes sat at the dining table, I have been known to kick my legs as if someone or something is holding them, grabbing them, trying to drag me to the abyss which is dementias lair. How often does this happen?? only Elaine knows, it can happen on a daily basis or weekly, nobody knows, dementia doesn’t run in straight lines and each person is so different.
I am so often asked how I cope with this? I always say it`s Elaine you should be asking, but I do try my best to explain. The thing is I have always been, and will always be, a half full kind of guy and I am by nature an optimist. Without going into detail so much has happened in my past, before my illness, and I have had to overcome come this, and proud to say I have done, that I see every day as a brand new challenge. I see hope everywhere I go, I have incredible kids and grandkids who have hope in their eyes every time I see them, I have seen and worked with teenagers who have been at rock bottom with the most horrific past life stories but they have overcome this and are now successful upstanding citizens, we do have so much to be grateful for. This is not led by belief of religion but by belief in the human race itself and the belief that Life will always find a way and so will we. A friend once told me ""
""You are who you are, because when you wake up in the morning, you put your boots on and not your slippers!!
There may well be some truth in that.
But the fact still remains I have dementia and I have bad days and good days, all well documented over the internet. Some days are wonderful, or what you call normal? But some days and nights are absolutely horrific and so hard to cope with, especially for my loving wife, who was a professional carer for thirty years before I was diagnosed, so even though I have dementia I still think myself as lucky, some are not so lucky and have to face this all alone, and by sharing my experiences its those I hope to help, as well as all affected by this awful disease, for as long as I can. As for the shadow man? He still comes and goes, and I still rebuke him at every turn up to now, but if you do see someone jumping, or shouting at someone YOU can’t see, please try to understand,
ITS SO VERY REAL FOR THEM
Till next time"

Is dementia care going the right way?,Norrms,2023-05-31T09:36:17+0100,0,"Is Dementia Care going the right way?  

Whilst I know there are problems with the national health service, caring service, and problems with the employment of staff but I don’t want to make this a political post, far from it, but we need to look at the consistency of care when it comes to caring for those with dementia. Living within dementia`s world is certainly hard enough as I know first-hand without the added problems of people with dementia being looked after by people who know absolutely nothing about the disease itself. Now, and these are my own personal views only, one, three hour course over the internet on dementia just doesn’t cut it for me, or someone shadowing another carer for a day (*Who also may not know anything about dementia) doesn’t work for me either. Elaine and I actually live in a care housing environment and have many friends who are living in the same building who need care, either in  house or from outside, and who also have dementia, and believe me, some on the stories we hear are so upsetting and yet can be made right by simple changes.
As founders of the Global Purple Angel dementia campaign we cannot just stand idly by and do nothing, they guys in the office and the care firm who works here on site must be sick and tired of hearing from us, but you are talking about looking after fellow human beings and not working on a building site or in a supermarket. AND!! The most annoying thing it’s NOT THE CARERS FAULT!! Those incredible carers , hero’s one and all in my eyes, have decided to dedicate their working days to looking after those less fortunate than themselves, but if they haven’t got the tools to do it “Knowledge” or the appropriate training given to them how can they look after people properly? Carers , both paid and unpaid are without a doubt the backbone of the UK. When it comes to dementia care it’s a little more complicated as it’s such a complex disease and nobody should expect all carers to know everything about it, nobody does, but small changes can make such a difference to those who have this disease. Continuity is so important when it comes to dementia and a familiar face is always welcomed, someone you can build a trust up with, so something as simple as simple as sending the same carer every time to the same person with dementia apart from holidays and sickness cant be that hard can it?
The same as sending an experienced carer in dementia to a person with this disease would also seem to be the sensible thing to do, or so you would think wouldn’t you? Sadly it’s not, and herein lies the problem. It would seem we live in a society that believe in as long as they have two arms and two legs we will employ them ,  but when it comes to dealing with fellow human beings how is this even possible, or acceptable, and yet we see it on a daily basis and hear about it all over the world, its not just a UK problem I may add. You can blame Brexit and the Cost of living crisis all you want but when it comes to dealing with fellow human beings this is far from being acceptable. The carers out there need our help, and the management of all care firms should stand up and be counted, because, one day, God forbid, it will be them being looked after by a carer who really wants to help them but can’t because of lack of training  Till next time ……"
Additude Matters!!!,Becca Lynn,2023-06-17T16:19:06+0100,0,"I am so grateful that I have been able to maintain a rather positive additude. I am currently 69 and have been dealing with the diagnosis for a few years now. Prior to that I had been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). I still do most of the driving in my family, but (fortunately) I no longer have to do our taxes. 

I am also a recovering alcoholic that has been sober over 40 years. I learned alot about the importance of additude when I first started attending meetings and following the 12 steps of AA. A big factor for me is remembering what I have to be grateful for. That is the type of issues that I prefer to focus on (unless I have a problem to solve...). 

One of the most important issues for me is to stay away from the ""Pitty Pot""!

any way after a few months i was told i had a hole in my heart and when i caughed a blood clot was travelling to my brain which left me were i am now!! any way since that time to now i have been picked up by the police because i was out with no trousers on, i had a brain scan in maidstone hospital and left there with a 12 ft lengh of blue towelling trailing behind me as it was stuck in the back of my trousers i set my kitchen alight, also i went to a urinary clinic and they put a camera in my privates when i came out my whole midsection was numb i walked back into the waiting area not knowing the whole of the front of my trousers were wet but it was ok there was only about 20 people there i find in my bad times to just laugh , but a big big love to altzeimer carers that must be so hard i hope there's a special place in heaven for you all your special people X Thank you"

Dancing in the Aisles
As I walked into the Gift store and café that Is China Blue in Totnes the song “Shake Shake Shake Senora, Shake it all the time “  started to play over the music system, and before I knew it , both my hands were raised in the air, fingers clicking, hips swaying and feet moving to the beat. I didn’t care where I was or who was watching, I knew I just loved this song and hadn’t heard it for a while. Was it my dementia? Was I having a moment > goodness me NO, i was happy, in the moment as they say and nothing else mattered. When the song was over I have to say there some strange looks from those having afternoon tea in the café, but some even clapped and cheered.
My Elaine? As always she smiled from ear to ear, rolled her eyes and said “IDIOT” under her breath, and laughed, it was the usual reaction from her as she’s used to me. You see, I have always been like that, I have always sang and danced when the mood takes me no matter where I am. Then it suddenly hit me!! How I missed dancing, now don’t get me wrong, I don’t mean ballroom or jiving, I was a child of the sixties and we danced our own dances to each and every song no matter how extravagant we looked. As I sat down for a well-earned cup of tea and slightly out of breath I may add, I thought about how and where I used to love dancing and how much I miss it.
My fitness levels are nowhere near where they should be even at my age and a long standing battle with my weight doesn’t help either, but the feeling that flows through my body when I hear certain music and the urge to move and shake my body to the beat has never gone away. Dementia hasn’t take that away from me and Woe betide it if it tried  (I have to say,if anybody knows what Woe betide means please let me know as my gran used to say it all the time and I still have no idea??)
My mind wandered back to the days I used to go to the discos at the Palais De Dance in my hometown of Bolton in the 1960s at the age of 15, I should have been 18, but that’s a story for another time, or to Scamps night club and danced the night away. Even though I am now in my 60s and have this  awful disease of dementia, some of my oldest memories still stay with me and dancing is one of them, WHOA!! I’ve just remembered I could even dance on Roller skates at the incredible Nevada Skating rink, now THOSE REALLY was the days. The one thing that is the common link to all this as you have probably guessed is Music, because it matters not if you have dementia or not, when a certain song/tune is played you can always remember where you where, who you were with, or shouldn’t have been with Tee hee,
So the next time  if you see some rather large bloke dancing away in the aisles of your local supermarket or the likes, having the time of his life (See what I did there?) please come and say HI
Till next time…………..

Changing Colours of the Season
I couldn’t imagine living anywhere else in the world with the glorious changing colours of the seasons. I was gazing at these wonderful views this morning when I started to think about how the seasons are very similar to life itself and the connection with Dementia.
Spring is like our births when the new born flowers and the rebirth of others push through the soil and are there for all to see with their fresh and young shoots growing rapidly into something quite beautiful.
Summer is all about things growing up and turning into adulthood whilst showing off their wonderful coats and colours, becoming mature and settled.
 Autumn is as we get older and things start to change. This is also the season that reminds me of my illness the most. As the trees and landscapes change their colours so do we with this awful illness and things seem to take on a different meaning? The leaves slowly but surely decay and start to look a shadow of their former selves. But as with anything all is not lost. If you look very closely, beyond the falling leaves and into the landscape you can still see the same beauty and soul that lives on within all of us. We are still here, as are the trees and fields, and we still need looking after and nurturing as does all living things.
 Unfortunately along comes the bleakness of winter (late stages of Dementia) when nothing seems to grow anymore and the landscape seems to fall silent. This is the worst time of all, especially for the nature lovers (carers) who just want things to get back to normal and the fields and trees to blossom again. But as we know, they sadly cannot during winter.
 I hope you have all enjoyed this little walk through the seasons with me, and even though it may seem a sad one, always remember the three seasons before season of WINTER and all it entails as these memories will hopefully stay with you forever…"

Lets dispel the Myths of dementia,Norrms,2023-03-08T09:47:06+0000,0,"This is how we dispel myths about dementia, please read on 

I’m going to continue to share our friend, Norm Mac’s writing. He tells it like it is regarding living with a dementia, in his case, Lewy Body Dementia. Norm is doing everything possible to educate folks about dementia, and he is doing a fantastic job! The following, below my writing, is from Norm today, March 6, 2023.
I keep telling you that all dementias aren’t Alzheimer’s, not all are about memory loss. Dementia is caused by the brain being damaged and disintegrating. Specific symptoms arise from which area of the brain is affected.
Comedian and actor, Robin Williams died from Lewy Body Dementia. He did not die from Clinical Depression. Lewy Body caused him to hear voices, have hallucinations, and to do things which in his undamaged mind, he would never have considered.
Actor Bruce Willis has FTD with Aphasia, the variant affecting his speech.
My husband, , had FTD, the variant causing loss of reasoning, judgment, insight and empathy. he did not lose his memory or speech. He lost his understanding of time, numbers, value of money and many others things requiring reasoning and judgment, which is quite a lot. He never lost his love for us or his epic musical abilities. He could still speak the 7+ languages he knew, and the week prior to his death he was still sitting at his piano, playing and singing in his golden voice.

Norm explains so much to us about how it feels to live with Lewy Body Dementia, which, no doubt Robin Williams felt as well. Thank you dear Norm.






DEMENTIA... A SLIP IN TIME
Where am I? Where am I? You hear me cry,
It all looks so different, why oh why?
How did  I  get here? where is this place?
Who`s sat over there?  An unfamiliar face!
This isn't my house, this is not my chair,
Why is life so very unfair?
I want to go home, I don't want to be here,
In strange surroundings, feeding my fear,
Then I am back, as quick as I went,
And all around me is heaven sent,
My beautiful wife sat right there
Here I am again, sat in my chair,
How long was I gone? it's just a slip in time,
I can never be sure what really is mine.

Lumber Puncture,Nonnajay,2022-09-16T07:40:58+0100,0,"Hello again ,

I have finally seen my neurologist again and this appointment with him was so very different from the first one where I had decided I didn’t like him straight away cause I felt he wasn’t really “listening” to what I was telling him and I felt he snubbed me off cause of my age (I’m 48 years young) 


Anyhow, he was absolutely wonderful and so understanding. First thing he said was the brown scan didn’t show anything like clots or tumours or anything bad like that. 

Then he said in a very changed and serious voice , and the cognitive test that we did with you  when you were here last , unfortunately you didn’t do very well with. He said now if you were 78 I wouldn’t of been too concerned with that result but since you are not 78 and are 48 , we have to take this a bit more serious . His whole face changed the way he was looking at me , and my daughter who was with me noticed it too, it was as if he thinks he knows what it is but won’t say just yet. 

I gave him the list of symptoms and changes I’ve noticed in me and what is happening with me and he looked so concerned but was so lovey about it all. 

He asked how long had I first noticed any memory issues and  I went blank so my daughter jumped in and said about 6 years and then he asked when did I notice it’s really becoming worse and I said the last year and he then asked my daughter would she agree with that and she said yes. 

So then he said ok, there are two other tests we will need to have done before we talk further on this and he said one is a psyche test that will take two hours and I have to have two of these and the other is a lumper puncture . He said the psyche test wil be to see if it’s depression or Alzheimer’s or dementia and if it is one of those then we will deal with that if that’s the case. He made me feel so at ease about it all. 

Now, I am absolutely terrified of a lumber puncture I have had so many spinal taps with 4 c sections in the past and the last one was horrific as the needle went in wrong and caused the most agonising pain I’ve ever had. It also left my legs to jerk uncontrollably ever since and that was 9 years ago. My legs jerk involuntarily 247 ever since I had that last spinal needle. 


My question is , can they not diagnose without the lumbar puncture? I REALLY don’t want it . Like it’s beyond a normal fear of it , I just can’t go through with it and I’m scared he will say if I don’t have it he can’t diagnose me. 

Sorry for such a long winded rant. 

I wil post my Symptoms if anyone is interested to read them. Maybe someone will be able to relate to what I’m going through with these symptoms and hopefully y won’t feel like me, very alone right now in this ."

Processing,Saint Billy,2023-03-21T10:54:50+0000,0,"Hi all,

Many thanks to this site for giving me the opportunity to unload.

I have been fighting cancer since 2015 and I am still receiving treatment, but recently I noticed symptoms that were unrelated ie short term memory loss, balance issues, not finding the right words etc. I managed to see the doctor, which isn't easy these, days and he did various tests including memory tests and decided to refer me to have an MRI. I had the MRI within two weeks, the quickness of which surprised me. I had the MRI despite the fact that I initially went to the wrong hospital, and was told I would receive the results in one week. A week went by, two weeks went by, but because of the stress the NHS is under at the moment and the current strikes I left it for a month. Still no news after a month so I rang the surgery to be informed that they haven’t received the results and that I had to chase up the hospital. I rang hospital who said that they had sent results but would send again. Another month went by with no news but on ringing the surgery they looked on their system and found that the results where indeed in and that a doctor will have a look and will call me if a problem is found. I then received a phone call in a couple of days from the receptionist who arranged an appointment for me to see a doctor in a weeks time. Obviously this left me feeling that an issue had been found but with no idea what.

I went to the appointment with my partner. The doctor who I had never seen before seemed very uncomfortable and started by asking me how I felt and if my memory loss is still persisting to which I said yes. I was anxious to know the results but the doctor seemed to be skirting the results of the scan until eventually she managed to tell me that the scans indicated shrinkage of the brain and that indicates dementia. I was not expecting that news and was taken aback. Having been lost in the system for over 2 months I had formed the opinion that it couldn’t have been that serious or I would have been contacted, but now I was confronting dementia. This news hit me much harder than cancer ever did.

I am now three weeks into waiting to be contacted by the memory clinic, which I was informed by the doctor could be between five to six weeks. My partner and family  have been a real source of support through all of this but I am having problems coming to terms with the whole thing. Having been let down by the medical system in my belief, my faith and trust in the system is at an all time low despite the wonderful cancer care I have received over the last few years.

I am now in a state of flux and feel somewhat abandoned by the system. I have been told that I more than likely have a life changing and life ending ending decease, and that was only down to my persistence, and now I am left to wait again to supposedly have it confirmed.  I have only just reached retirement age but had many plans for the future including seeking new employment. I had also recently proposed to my partner whom I have been with for four years. I have accumulated lots of equipment to assist me with a hobby I have but now of course this news puts a whole new perspective on things. I also feel somewhat in denial due to how I had to fight for the results of the test and my new found lack of trust.

Apologies for the long first post but it was hard to condense this into a couple of paragraph."

So what did I learn?,Dunroamin,2023-03-13T06:34:35+0000,0,"So a trip for 3 months with alzheimers.  They say travel broadens the mind and I have done so pre-diagnosis for over 40 years, mostly alone, mostly with a backpack.  Thank goodness I did.

Now: my tolerance for noise is much reduced, as is my patience when surrounded by crowds of people.  I can no longer function in a directional way (finding routes, etc.) Remembering times and dates and travel details was completely beyond me. I found my approach of letting people know my diagnosis was either of great help or  resulted in the total embarrassment of others.   Solitude remains my friend and in remote areas, found my peace.  Thankfully there were many.  Fatigue was immense and I spent long periods sleeping.  Nature came to my rescue many times and I seemed to have an increased interaction with many animals  (Do they know?)  Wild sea swimming was envigorating. 

Throughout my career dealing with the crisis situations and the anguish and grief of many did not stand me in good stead for arriving in one country in a category 3 severe cyclone.  It  merely reinforced  the reliance we all have  on technology, and my own (new) incompetence of dealing with such a  situation. 

Would I do it again?  Well this trip was against well meaning advice and I gained so much in precious moments.  So probably yes.  My carer, probably no if I am honest, but he says no way should either of us have been deprived of the experience."

Dementia and driving,Norrms,2022-09-30T15:40:06+0100,0,"DEMETIA AND DRIVING



WOW!! This is such a divisive subject but I feel it’s something we need to chat about.
QUESTION? After receiving a diagnosis of dementia should they, with the diagnosis, give up Driving?
Ans? (My own personal answer only and in my humble opinion) is a straight YES without a doubt.
The reason in my eyes is simple, as a person living with dementia I could not, would not and should not be allowed anywhere near sitting behind the wheel of a car as my reactions, my spatial awareness, my confusions and so much more would be an incredible danger to all on the road. As a family man myself just the thought of hurting a child or anyone else with a car and the damage it can do abhors me and frightens me to death and it should others.


Question ? if your given a diagnosis or dementia does your Dr automatically contact the DVLA and tell them ??

Answer is ?? Incredibly NO??  I find this absolutely disgusting because, say, if you have an epileptic fit you are banned automatically from driving for 12 months, please will somebody tell me what the difference is? Either way you are a danger not only to yourself but also the general public. Dementia, after all is just another illness and needs to be treated as such. I know a lot will come back and say what about their independence, their way of life, confidence, it’s something they have always done, and I do appreciate that, but what about the consequences? What about those, who get a visit at the door from our wonderful police force to give you the bad news that a loved one has just been killed, or is in hospital with life changing injuries? How can anybody justify that when it could have been so easily avoided?

I have heard so many reasons in the past why they should be allowed to drive after diagnosis and I have listened to all of them, but at the end of the day they are still in charge of a huge machine which can do so much damage to many when the confusion descends, it really is as simple as that.  One of the most incredible reason’s I heard of and is sadly still used today is..

“They only have a touch of dementia” “A touch of dementia? Is that the same as being a TOUCH PREGNANT?


I have never heard anything so ridiculous in my life, how can you have a Touch of dementia when it’s a terminal disease, do people get a Touch of Cancer?? No, they don’t so I find it absolutely incredible some people still think like this in this day and age. Nobody is saying is not hard to adjust to not driving when you have done it most of your life, especially when there is only one in the relationship that drives but it really is something that has to be done. You wouldn’t, or shouldn`t knowingly get in a car with someone who has been drinking would you? So again, please explain to me what the difference is? Giving up driving is extremely hard and that’s so appreciated but so is being told you have a terminal disease of dementia and there is no cure. There shouldn’t be any choice in this, it applies to many other illnesses and so it should regarding dementia. Maybe something our local MPs should be lobbying the government about to Save lives?

When it all becomes to much,Norrms,2023-01-12T10:29:41+0000,0,"WHEN IT ALL BECOMES TO MUCH

If your living with someone who has dementia, there will come as time, as sure as the day dawns, that difficult decisions will have to be made and the most difficult one of all is when to admit a loved one to a care home. As much as most people don’t want to think about it, that day will probably come. Along with that, comes something which is known as the Guilt Monster, oh yes, he is sure to visit you and make to doubt all you have done and all your about to do. I would just like to hopefully reassure you all and let you know this really is so perfectly normal and say he isn’t real!! So many people before you have felt the same way and so many will after, the thing to try and remember is, you are not alone in this and you certainly have done all you can both psychically and mentally to help your loved one.



The guilt monster will try and tell you different, it will place doubt in your mind, and you will ask yourself “Am I doing the right thing “How will they cope without me? Will the care home be good enough and also “Is this what they would have wanted? In my case, the answer would be yes, and I mean a HUGE YES as I am so grateful for all my wife has done for me and fully confident whatever decision she makes will be in my best interest, and please remember, also hers. Whatever comes or goes please please always remember that this illness also plays a huge part on the wellbeing those who care for those with dementia as well. I don’t mean to frighten anybody but it can take a huge toll on the carer’s health as well and that’s why we always try to advise that “Don’t let their illness become your illness” and as hard as it is it is possible to keep the two apart with help and support around you. Sadly, for some, they leave it that late that the decision for a loved one to be put in care is taken out of their hands and that’s because the Guilt monster has paid a visit and they want to try and keep them at home for as long as possible which is very understandable, but when it really all becomes too much, please don’t listen to the monster, listen to your health, think about all you have done, how hard it’s been and how it will benefit all to having some kind of respite.

You may want to start by arranging weekend respite , or a couple of days during the week before you take the plunge into full time care, remember it’s your choice and whatever suits you. I can remember when we advised this to someone we once knew, and they said that having the whole day to themselves felt like having a month’s holiday it had such an impact. What you don’t need is somebody else from the health services to take this decision out of your hands and placing your loved one in somewhere you know nothing about or haven’t read up on or what it’s like to be cared for there. That’s when the Guilt monster really will come to visit you and make you feel bad. Please don’t be put off by what you sometimes read about in some newspapers re care homes and please be assured that all are not the same and there really are some incredible care homes out there for your loved one, the Purple Angel Dementia Campaign Torbay will always be here to help you

Well, we are now well and truly into 2023 and the year ahead is stretching out in front of us, so what of the year to come? It’s going to be a tough one for all I think, that’s, as they say, is a “Given” so this year I am going to explain all I know and all I have learned for making the lives of those with dementia and their families just that little bit better and try to improve the wellbeing of all those affected by this awful disease as well as explain what it’s like to live with dementia and also updates from the Purple Angel Dementia Campaign and all its up to. We will chat about Nutrition, Hydration as well as things going on for carers around Torbay to help them get some much-needed “ME TIME.

After the Euphoria (or not ) of Christmas and New Year we sometimes come down to earth with a bump, I know I do, as Christmas festivities are a huge thing in our house, and dementia or not, we try and make the best of it. But there is always that little empty feeling at the beginning of January with the dread of the coming months and facing another year of not knowing where to go or what to do when dementia touches your lives, especially for the first time, so we will start at the very beginning as Julie Andrews once sang. I am so often asked how come I have managed to live so long with this disease and yet others sadly pass away after only a few years and my answer is always the same. At the very first sign of forgetfulness becoming a problem please seek a diagnosis. Go straight to your Doctor with your concerns and ask for an appointment to see someone in the memory clinic or the equivalent in your part of the world. You see we all have forgetfulness, even kids forget things, but when it comes to forgetting how to get dressed, where you live, being lost when out or how to use a knife and fork, then you must please act quickly. I had a very early diagnosis along with a scan of my brain and even though it took a while to get the medication right, though not a cure, it certainly helped me, but a very early diagnosis is such a must!! When all said and done, if your results come back as clear, just think of the relief you will feel, if not, I promise you, once you have got your hear around it, a feeling of relief also ensues as at least you know what’s going on and you’re not just becoming more forgetful as they say.

It’s the not knowing that can hurt the most, the confusion, the “FOG” as they call it in front of your eyes and the frustration when everybody keeps telling you , you are getting things wrong, trust me, even for someone as placid as myself it used to drive me up the wall, I was convinced the whole world was wrong and I was right, when it turned out it was the other way around, but once you know you can start to understand it, even if only a little, it does help. Living with dementia for both diagnosed and families is without a very grey area and a quagmire of emotions and frustrations, but hopefully, week by week I will try and make it a little easier for you and clear and simply as I can, but
please remember

Dementia and the memory Stick,Norrms,2022-12-16T08:52:27+0000,0,"Dementia and the Memory Stick.
Well, it’s that time of year again when my young grandchildren ask me what I want for Christmas, the conversation goes something like this…….
Hiya Grandad, what do you want for Christmas this year? I reply “a memory stick, please!! They are all very well aware of my memory problems and always say “OH Grandad! You asked for that last year. “ I know I did, and I still remember all your names so it must gave worked, so can I have another one, please?? At this point, I would like to say it’s always good to laugh with us and not at us as we still enjoy a laugh as much as anybody else does. The older ones walk away, still laughing and shaking their heads. The younger ones still sit there wondering how all this works ?
Now, a little-known fact is, I am a HUGE SCI-FI fan and the thought of a memory stick being inserted at the bottom of my head in a slot that brings up all my happy memories forever and a day is, admittedly, like something I have seen is Star Wars, but do you know what? It’s not as far-fetched as you think! You see, memories have always existed, and so do now memory sticks, so ……….
Imagine your computer/laptop is your brain and you have saved so many happy memories onto a simple memory stick. Pictures, photos, music, holidays, marriages, nights out, days on the beach, christenings birthdays, I could go on, and when you place that memory stick into the computer / your brain and show the person with dementia all these happy times it doesn’t seem that far-fetched does it, and without the surgery LOL, so you see, modern technology and the brain (The oldest tech in the world), can work together and you can make someone’s Christmas so very special this year, or any year, or any month just by doing this.
 When the person with dementia is sitting in the house surrounded by their loving family and friends on Christmas day and wondering who these people are and what all the fuss is about, confused and maybe a little frightened, by showing the memoirs on a laptop or computer will help them remember the good times and also hopefully help them remember some people who are even in the room on that day, how cool is that ?? please remember

They pranced, danced, ducked and dived., took off, swirled around, shouted, landed.  Repeat.  This went on for over an hour interspersed with the odd foray onto the roof where the clog dancing started.  They did not seem alarmed or spooked, merely enjoying themselves.   

 Someone then pointed to a lone crow definitely playing.  It had found an empty coconut shell and was jumping around it, dribbling it like a ball.  Then it flew up  it in its beak and dropped it several times.  So intent on its game the dogs were largely ignored.

The long Road,Norrms,2022-08-12T09:51:38+0100,0,"A Long Road
It may well be a long road, but most of the time I don’t mind. I have lived with dementia for 11 years now and so many people tell me of their stories about how loved ones only live six or seven years after diagnosis, and each time I hear them I quietly weep inside for those we have lost to such a cruel disease. Some even look at me with a puzzled look and say 11 years?? How can that be? Well, the good news is since I was diagnosed I have always been a believer of “You wouldn’t go to war without knowing your enemy would you? So as well as building up a worldwide dementia group, I have also spoken to and made friends with many people around the world and the first thing I did learn is there are so many living with dementia after, 15, 20 and even 25 years !!! I know! Incredible isn’t it but all perfectly true. Is there an answer to this? Sadly not and here’s why…..

There are so many named variations of dementia and then, in my humble opinion variations within variations and what I mean by that is as an example, we have the flu virus, but there are 1000s of flu virus out there, and I believe the same applies to dementia. I have the Lewy body’s type dementia, but that doesn’t mean I have exactly the same symptoms as the next person diagnosed with Lewy body’s dementia, similar in some parts? Yes of course, but never exactly the same, and that is the reason I believe some live longer than others. In the dementia world there is a saying that once you have met one person with dementia you have met one person with dementia and that’s so true. You have to remember even though the building blocks of the brain are all the same, the information that’s collected in it over a life time is completely different to anybody else’s because of your own personal life’s experiences. We all act differently; we all talk and think differently we all have different tastes, we certainly all see things differently. If you have ever been to a football/ cricket match with thousands of other we all watch a different game. That’s because we are all Unique, so when dementia invades your brain it will react differently, one size does certainly fit all. That’s why I believe (Again in my humble opinion) is why its so difficult to find a cure for this awful disease.
I believe there is no point in looking for a cure for say the Alzheimer’s strain in general, or Lewy body’s, or vascular dementia etc , a bold statement I know but please bear with me, I believe we
should find out how many approx. strains of Alzheimer’s etc. there is and concentrate on the one that is most prevalent and work from there. This would give is a better opportunity to understand how the other strains work. Of course as I said this is my humble opinion and I am in no way, shape or form an academic but what I am is someone who actually lives with this disease and sees first- hand what is going on around me by being in touch with so many across the world who have been touched by this disease.
Talking of touched, I was approached by someone who said to me their wife had a “ touch “ of dementia, when I asked is that the same as being a “Touch “ pregnant they looked bemused??

I have just joined the forum 5 minutes ago; I have been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's. (Aged 68)
I have been living with it for 3 years, plus.
I have been on 5mg of Donepezil for 1 week. 
Last night I had a very fast heart rate after going to bed, which I do not normally have, it woke me from my sleep.
At the time I was having an extremely vivid dream. Which I know that I would not normally experience.

The heart rate bothered me, has anyone else experienced this?"
Changed role in family,Pejic,2022-11-08T10:27:05+0000,0,"I have always been the one in the family it was so problems and made decisions. With the advance of my symptoms I have lost much of my ability to confidently analyse what the problem is let alone deduce any solutions, and even when I do, my confidence in those solutions and decisions it is much degraded. Unfortunately my wife still relies on my ability to do these things and seems to be refusing to accept that these responsibilities are having to pass on to her now. Not only that, she's now taken to berating me because I won't do things which I used to be able to do and which are now really beyond me. The nagging and shouting and insisting, gets me into a real state and I have to tell her to go away from me and leave me alone, which results in more whining about why I'm not thinking about her more.
When I told my Alzheimer's care assistant about my concerns she referred my wife to the Admiral Nurse Service who offered to put her in touch with a carer support group, which I thought might help her by talking to other people dealing with people like me to understand what problems I might be having. Unfortunately she dismissed any offers of help saying she didn't need them.
I am not too optimistic about how things are going to develop, I have suggested she registers on this site which might give her some clues as to what goes on but that hasn't happened and I don't know how to register her myself - I don't remember how I registered myself even.
There are no family or friends to intervene and our GPS are worse than useless."

I’ve recently been given diagnosis on Early onset dementia, and I’ve been told by a friend I can get a chip and signature card, I’m just wanting to know how this works, when are the funds debited from my account, how long it takes for funds to be debited.

Feeling saddened,Dunroamin,2022-10-18T09:36:33+0100,0,"Just back from a wonderful hot sunny break, pool, relaxation, supportive friends and so on.  However, it coincided with my brain locking into an awareness of what my Alzheimer's is doing to my wonderful OH.  He is turning into a perpetually (it seems to me) worried individual who seems unable to switch off.  He is TALT, very confused about the future but feeling unable to make plans.  I acknowledge that his continuing visual problems (despite 4 operations) contribute to his declining cognitive skills and as a retired professional life long carer and prescriber to others, this I find so hard.

I feel so saddened by all this whilst acknowledging that my empathy is not always what it was.  In fact some days I become quite frustrated at the inability of others to 'sort themselves out' - and this is not 'me.'  I realise many  PWD do not often react well to a strange environment but this foray to foreign parts luckily coincided with a period of normality for me and I have learned a great deal about myself, and of others.  I now feel I am entering what my OH calls a 'retreating phase' while I try to work all this out.  I have started painting again and look forward to cold water swims and seeking solace in nature. 

Sorry for the rambling self indulgent post.  Writing this (with help) does make things a bit clearer for me.  The awareness that my insight, compassion and empathy are in fact declining (along with other things) is so very hard though"

Hard Times,Norrms,2022-09-05T09:27:37+0100,0,"HARD TIMES ……..



 Some days are hard, some are much harder, and at one point over the weekend I hit a very low point. You see, there comes a time when people with dementia get so very tired of fighting it. The exhaustion of the hallucinations, lack of sleep and night terrors can really catch up with you and you sit there wondering what it is all about. The last week has been a rough one as I struggled with my life skills and even worse for me, I couldn’t remember how to tie my knots when I went fishing which is something I love to do. As anybody knows you can have the most expensive gear in the world (I haven’t by the way) but if you don’t tie the knot properly you don’t catch fish and you lose a lot of fishing tackle which can very expensive. That, as well as self-doubt, a misunderstanding of most that’s going on and staggering around as if drunk because my spatial awareness was all over the place doesn’t help when all mixed together. You start to doubt your self-worth, start to think “ Is this when I go over the edge after teetering on it for so long, what will happen now?? All these questions and more race though your mind at 100 miles an hour. Most with dementia never speak about this, most will keep it to themselves and sit and feel so isolated and very lonely and that is why support from family and friends is so very important. A persons personality may well change a little, or a lot when they get dementia, but I am convinced that it doesn’t disappear altogether and if you look close enough you can still see the “OLD” person as they say. It’s when you start to see the person you once knew becoming quieter, more sullen, loss of appetite or more lethargic than usual you should act and sit and talk to them more often than you do, a comforting arm or hug never hurt anybody. I also believe listening skills are so important as well as even if the person with dementia is making no sense to you whilst talking to you, remember, it makes perfect sense to them and, if you listen very carefully you may hear the words, pain, or cold, or thirsty pop up in the sentence’s now and again and this could also be the cause of them disappearing inside themselves. I have always said can you even imagine having toothache and not being able to make someone understand you are in such pain, how awful must that be?

There is something very primeval that’s lives deep inside each and everyone of us which is our survival instincts and those with dementia are no different, ok admittedly not all are fighters, but some are, and with the help and support of those around us we can slowly, and sometimes painfully, come out of the feeling of hopelessness that is dragging us down to the abyss and back to the land of the living as I call it to fight another day. A very close and good friend of mine who also has dementia once said “I know I will probably never live to see a cure for dementia, but I hope I live long enough to see a world that Understandings it better.

Never a truer word spoken

till next time"

Doing Too much or not ENOUGH ?,Norrms,2022-09-13T10:07:49+0100,0,"DOING TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH?



Doing too much or not enough? That’s a tough one to answer when you have dementia. This something I have struggled with since being diagnosed with this awful disease. When I was first diagnosed I tried to pack so many things in as fast as I could. We had just moved and had a new garden to play with as I called it. I have always grown my own plants from seed and done the usual thing of ordering the magazines etc, but this time I ordered so many seeds and bought so many seeding trays, and they were all plants I have never grown before!! Before I knew it I had seedlings all over the place, every windowsill was full, and the mini greenhouse bursting at the seams etc., and believe me our garden isn’t that BIG!! Eventually my wife Elaine sat me down and told me I was “Over compensating “ to which I replied “ No I’m not, I’m petrified, I am so scared I won’t have time to do what I want to do before dementia takes over, and that was the crux of it, I wanted everything done and wanted it done yesterday. At this point I will say that some might say I have always been like that (especially when I was a manager) but this was different, there was urgency to this.

And so it carried on for years, not only my illness but staying so busy, we used to speak at conferences up and down the UK, sometimes having as many as three meetings a day as well as running the Torbay dementia action alliance which as you know is now the Purple Angel dementia campaign . My argument was that if I kept busy it would keep my mind busy and stave off, or try to, further symptoms of dementia but sadly I had forgotten (No pun Intended) one thing. It was my wife who was doing all the driving, all the running round, organising overnight stays in Hotels etc. It was Elaine who had to cope with me in the evening when I was absolutely exhausted and sundowning so badly. We carried on for years until one Christmas Elaine was really poorly and it suddenly dawned on me how selfish I had been. The work we had done, and I say WE for one HUGE REASON, the awareness about dementia we had spread  and also the authorities we had challenged to change things for the better has had some wonderful productive results, but at what cost??

Somebody said to me the other day “if you could go back ten years and give yourself some advice what would it be? My answer was “ I would tell myself to stop being so very selfish and think about my wonderful wife , try to hit a happy medium and stop being so very stubborn. And that’s what we have done now. Most will say I am still as busy but not in the way I was, I am not well enough to travel the UK for conferences these days but in the days of such incredible technology I can still be there, via zoom. I can sit in the comfort of my own home and talk about my illness to huge audiences, hopefully educate and yes you have guessed it, I can still be a thorn in the side of the powers that be by working for change and for  better conditions in the health settings for those with dementia and I promise I will until I am not physically or mentally capable to do so."

Oh What to do ??,Norrms,2022-09-27T10:04:06+0100,0,"Oh what to do ?

There was a time we all retired at 60 and 65 and I have to say when I was first diagnosed I always said that if I was lucky enough to live that long I would do the same at 65. Well, on one hand I am pleased to say I am still here, but I have now just passed that birthday and still working (in my own way, blogging and raising awareness about dementia) so what now? Do I retire at the NEW age of 66?? This will give me just one more year, if my illness allows me, to do as much as possible and then sail off into the sunset with Elaine on a boat called DIGNITY (I WISH LOL) well, you know what I mean, but it’s definitely something to think about.


Nobody lives forever and I have dedicated 13 years of my life to raising awareness, speaking at conferences, blogging in newspapers and magazines, and creating organisations, which I hope will carry on the work long after I am gone, writing books, writing songs, opening memory café`s worldwide, creating the Mp3 campaign here in the UK, and a little bit more so there is so much to think about in the next year. One the one hand something deep deep inside tells me there is so much yet to do, and their certainly is!! But should I, next year step completely back and spend more time with my one and only love (besides my kids that is) Elaine? Or just carry on doing what i do?
The feedback from the M3s and zooms I do worldwide and  the looks on peoples Facebook at the memory cafes raises my spirits so much and spurs me onto do so much more, and yet, sometimes I get so very very tired, confused and just want to sit on an island with Elaine and watch the sun go down. So, certainly a lot to think about over the coming months,

Should I stay or should I go??

Just love that song LOL xxxx"
A message to all on World Alzheimer's day,Norrms,2022-09-21T12:22:14+0100,0,"A MESSAGE TO ALL ON WORLD ALZHEIMERS DAY
To all attending conferences today worldwide, what will you take away from the meeting ?
Please let me explain......
I have attended more conferences and meeting re dementia than I can remember and the one thing I still don't understand is what people take away from it and what they do about it after? By this I mean we have all been to meetings where someone puts ideas tree up, or has a whiteboard full of people's ideas, or even sits around writing ideas down and then discussing them after, but what really annoys me is WHAT HAPPENS AFTER ????
Who takes the responsibility of deciding which are the best ideas and putting them into practice, how many conferences have you been to where they start with This is what we discussed last year and this is what we have now put into practice???  I would hedge my bets as to NONE or very little.
Its ok going to these things, sitting there networking, having a free lunch and some just going for the JOLLY  but what exactly comes out of it at the end?? Absolutely Nothing usually .
If we are going to help those with dementia practically then these ideas trees etc need and must be turned into viable actions to be recorded and shared, or what's the POINT?? You may well sit there for hours like I used to do and think well? thats five hours of my life I will never get back, and still the help and encouragement that people living with dementia, their loved ones and their carers need doesn't change for another year and we are no further on,
COME ON GUYS ITS ACTION WE NEED
Leys TURN tour words and ideas into ACTIONS for a
change !!

Not going out ...........,Dunroamin,2022-09-19T17:43:51+0100,0,"I am writing this at the suggestion of my OH (and with his help)

There have been several posts about PWD not wanting to go out, or wanting to return home early - spoiling the enjoyment of others.  I thought an ""insiders"" perspective would help in understanding.

My Alzheimer's was diagnosed over three years ago.  At home and in its immediate surrounds I function pretty well with just the odd (albeit increasing) aberration.  I swim outdoors weekdays in unheated water.  I put on my goggles and swim in peaceful isolation overseen by the most amazing supportive lifeguards.  I enjoy quiet conversations and my garden.  Reading is becoming more problematical, as are IT matters.

Going out to places means I am faced with places and situations unfamiliar to me.  IT is away from a usual routine and I find it difficult to be aware of the time limits placed on me by others. I am expected to cope with noise and people.  I am expected to understand and follow the conversations of people unused to me or of whom i am uncertain. Listening to others. trying to internalise, rationalise and respond to the spoken words uses up a tremendous amount of energy for me, leaving me exhausted.  I do not know where the toilet is.  I become restless and want to return home and lose the grace to be kind and pleasant to others.  

Following my obvious withdrawal from things, it seems the penny drops and I am returned to the peaceful surroundings I am used to.  Unfortunately I then seem to sleep for several days while (in my mind) my brain recharges somewhat.

This, from a previously independent solo world traveller, socially aware and constantly on the go whose world is slowly slipping out of my grasp.  Unpleasant for my carers, but I kid you not - horrendous for me too."
Alzheimer’s/Dementia Symptoms,Nonnajay,2022-09-18T09:07:47+0100,0,"I have been battling with wether to post this today or not because I don’t want to over do asking questions on here and I know and don’t expect answers off anyone I have a neurologist for that. But it is nice to speak to those who have Alzheimer’s or those who are caring for someone with it questions because they are living it . 

I just want to ask if  anyone else has any of these symptoms that I am sharing of my own. Or do does your loved one have any of these or could you share what their symptoms are with me . 


My Symptoms 

Not been able to think of simple Words and always trying to find a word and then having to stop in conversation because I can't think of a word. This happens every single day all throughout the day. I am Constantly not able to think of a word I need to use. I will sit and try and try and it just doesn't come to me and I have to give up. It's so frustrating and upsetting feeling so stupid all the time. 
.


Always saying the wrong words. I know what I want to say and when I start to talk I will say a word that makes no sense to what I'm trying to talk about . It's like my brain picks a different word to what I wanted to say. Sometimes I notice I have done it and most the time I don't even notice it anymore and then of course my kids will tell me I said the wrong word , or they will say don't you mean this (right word). 



Forgetting everything . Forgetting what I talked about minutes after I was talking. Forgetting when things happens I feel it was yesterday but then I find out it could be months ago or even a year ago. Forgetting what things are called all things like objects, flowers , places everything. Forgetting any appointments made all the time. Forgetting to pay things like bills , Afterpay ect . Can't remember anything someone asks me to do and then they get mad at me for it because I'm always saying ""I forgot"" can't run a Bath cause I forget it's running. Sometimes I forget to take my top of and undies and get into the bath with them still on, It's all so very frustrating ?

Can't read books anymore because I'll just forget everything I read by the time I get to the bottom of the page. Now I'm starting to get jumbled when even reading one line in anything I'm reading and can't seem to comprehend what I'm reading it's like mumble jumble to me and I will have to then read that same line a few times to let it sink in what it said. 

Can watch the same show over and over and still not remember a thing each time. It's like watching it for the first time every time. 

Starting to not recognise my own things/belongings and think it's someone else's not mine (that's terrifying to me) 

Sometimes I wake at night and forget for a few minutes where the hell I am. I don't know what house I'm in or will think I'm in a house from 10 years ago. (That is also extremely scary and upsetting to me) 

I've lost interest in just about every thing I ever loved or enjoyed doing. Just don't feel motivated or seem to care about even going out the house so I don't anymore. I can't find new interests because I just don't care to have any. 

Called my granddaughter who lives with us since she was born a different name that we don't even have in the family and burst into tears when I realised I had done it. 

I'm forgetting people like my own children who have left home. I just don't think about them until someone mentions them . I feel like I'm forgetting important people in my life and it's devastating to me.  

Not been able to add/calculate in my head anymore like I use to. I was always very quick and adding in my head and now can't do that. Most times now I just give up trying. 

I feel I'm losing who I am and becoming someone else. It's just horrendous and a feeling of hopelessness. I'm aware of these things and some I'm starting to not even notice anymore and only do because my younger kids point it out to me. I know I'm not right in the head anymore , I know it and it's damn frustrating and makes me feel stupid all the time. I feel so stupid everyday of my life now. 

Strangely so, my long term memory is becoming so clear to me that I am remembering things I've not even thought about for 30 years or more. It's quite astonishing to me how well I am remembering things from my childhood. 

I forgot how to get out of a coles store that I have known for years and I couldn't remember which way to go to get out of the shop but thank god my daughter was there with me to help me. 

We drive past places I do not recognise at all and I'll ask where we are and it will be somewhere we have driven past a thousand times down from our house"

As I sat in the garden, with the evening sun going down I noticed how the sunlight danced on the heads of all our flowering rudbeckias. it shone through our apple trees, the lights dappling and swaying along the back border in time with the branches. The sun peeped its wondrous head over the top and i sat and watched as it dipped lower in the sky.
The colors changed before my eyes as the dimming darkness crept up, silently and with no warning, covering the tops of the trees with the shade that had only been lit up in sunlight minutes before. a breeze swept through, only a small one but enough to make the temperature down a little and i shivered.
It was reminding me of something but i could just think what it was?
Then, 20 minutes or so later the Plants were beginning to be covered by shade, and one by one, it was if someone had switched their light off and their heads drooped. I watched, with impending doom as the garden itself started to become dark and ominous and soon realized what i thought i was watching. The darkness crept in silently and would eventually cover all, just like dementia does, silently as it marches on with nothing to stop it, and as sure as the world turns this will always happen until they find a cure.
I came into the house and sat in my chair, desperately trying to find something positive about this as I always do, then it hit me.
In the morning the dawn light will arrive again, and light things up, it will shine down on all that is good, warm us, comfort us lead us to a brand new day before the darkness arrives again.
This is our HOPE,, The DAWN of every day, this is our CURE, A NEW DAY, and I believe every day we are one day closer to a cure

A Load of Compromising,Norrms,2022-08-28T10:16:50+0100,0,"“There’s been a load compromising…….”
“On the road to my horizon………”

If ever there were two lines from a song that hit home, these are the two, and of course sung by the late great Glen Campbell who passed away with dementia, because no matter who you are, if you have dementia or looking after someone who has, the word compromising comes into it every single day without a doubt, if fact I would say that it’s a huge part of the illness, and here's why…


When someone is diagnosed with dementia, their world, and all around them are suddenly turned upside down. Nothing is ever quite the same again. The person who has just been told has also been told they are dying as it’s a terminal disease, whichever way you dress it up, that’s what it is, and with early intervention, many understand this when told and are so frightened. Once the family and loved ones are told then they also become frightened as most know there is no cure but they also become confused because maybe they just don’t know that MUCH ABOUT DEMENTIA. No fault of their own as it’s not something most people like to think about, and so it goes on. This is where the wonderful word Compromising comes into it. 

People have to realise that nothing will be the same again and as the disease progresses and the person with dementia will say and do some weird and wonderful things that are perfectly ok for them to do so, in their world. But in anybody else’s world they could be the most out of character thing you have ever seen which will come as such a shock, so what to do ??

Well apart from starting with a few deep breaths, always advisable, the most important thing to try and remember, and I say try, because sometimes it’s so hard to do, is that it’s the disease that’s making them say that, and do that and not the person you once knew before the disease hit. And as sure as the day dawns, sometimes there will be times when you’re feeling of embarrassment will engulf you, of course, it will!! But you are only Human, it happens to each and every one of us on the planet at some time or other. I promise you that will pass and do you no lasting harm, I have never heard anybody going to the Dr and saying “ I`m not well as I am so embarrassed! 
 What I would ask you to try and remember and please tell others around you at the time it happens, is “How do you think the person with dementia would feel if they really knew what was going on and what they were doing?? Can you imagine?? This person you are looking at could be the most polite, shy retiring person you have ever met, yet here they are, running around naked, swearing like a trouper, or just being downright nasty to all. If this seems shocking I am sorry but it’s the truth these things could happen and I know many carers who are reading this will agree. This is where compromise comes into it, from everybody, we have to try and realise that the chemicals and disturbance in the brain is causing this is caused by dementia itself and not the person you see in front of you. And as hard as it  is sometimes, please try to remember this is not YOUR FAULT , NOT ONE BIT xxx"
Now useless,Casbow,2022-06-06T11:30:24+0100,0,"I was diagnosed with Frontotemporal  Dementia  2 years ago. I had been visiting my husband who had Vascular dementia 3 times a week and my driving was worrying me. I started to walk there and back as much as I could (It was a long walk.) Then after he was in the Care home for 2 years he died suddenly with a seizure  and infection. It was 10 o'clock in the evening and I was told on the telephone. The shock was awful and I was so upset that I had not been able to hold his hand and comfort him at the time.   So 6 months later I asked to see someone because I was sure I had some form of dementia.            I was diagnosed as I said with Frontotemporal which is not quite so well known as the others. My reason for writing is that I have had two bad fall outs with my eldest son. . And he will not have anything to do with me. He said I say horrible things about people and family and when  I said I could not remember saying  bad things and maybe it was the dementia.  He said  ""No you have always been like that."" My younger son and his wife have been very supportive until  I have now upset them. They say I always put people down and expect to much from them. I tried to defend myself by saying that I think its the dementia as I don't think I used to be like this. I am very lonely and having given up driving , do not go out very far, Since the pandemic some of my friends of many years are not able to get out through health problems. so I cannot see them although we speak on the phone. I am now becoming  embarrassed to be in company as I am sure people don't really want to see me. I  will not go on anymore. Just wondered if my saying things wrong is a symptom of this form or dementia."

Why am I so insignificant and worthless. I was told as a child I was totally useless,  clumsy, brainless, and no one would want to be associated with me I was a thing not a person.

FEELING LOST,Norrms,2022-08-05T10:28:38+0100,0,"LOST

Have you ever felt as if you are lost? I mean really lost? I don’t mean you have forgotten where you are going or what you were doing, or taken the wrong turn, but lost within yourself? I will try to explain…..


The last couple of days I have felt as if I am walking in an endless wilderness of despair and frustration. Some may say that`s depression and I am a firm believer that dementia and depression comes hand in hand anyway because when you are told you have a terminal disease? How can it not ? But this is so different. Lately my wife has said “Norrms” you look lost, are you ok?? When I ask what she means she says I have that look of bewilderment in my eyes as not sure what’s going on around me, or where I am or what I am doing and as much as I hate to admit it she is right . I can sit there and just stare into space, I can look around when out, and wonder where I am and what I am doing there. One of the most frightening things is, when I have flashbacks from the night before after having hallucinated most of the night, I can be sat the having a coffee in the middle of a cafe when suddenly I jump and scream as if the devil himself has shown up. I can only imagine what people think because I know i probably would if I didn’t know anything about dementia, and who can blame them??





The emptiness and loneliness that wells up inside is so debilitating and I wouldn’t wish it on anybody, your mind try’s to remember things gone past. I sit there and think “What did we do yesterday, or the day before? In my mind I am trying to keep my memories alive by recalling them as often as I can, training in brain not to forget, but sadly this is not always the case as I clench my hands in frustration because someday I cannot ever remember what I had for breakfast, let alone the day before!! When you have the most loving family ever around you and many friends both here and across the world it’s hard to believe that anybody can feel so lost but this illness of dementia affects so many in so many different ways, one size certainly does not fit all . It’s also hard to believe that when you see us all bouncing around, singing and laughing at our memory café that the same person can sit there, ever so lost, with the look of a little boy who has been separated from his parents in a supermarket on his face and tears running down his eyes.

This disease is ever so cruel in many different ways, it’s just not about losing your inhibitions or forgetting this and that it’s about feeling like you are becoming somebody else, somebody you don’t know or even like, a complete stranger, and I have to say it isn’t very nice as you can imagine. So please can I ask something of you all? the next time you see someone sitting there, looking completely lost, it may or may not be dementia, but I can assure you if you just have a word, ask how they are and if they are ok, it will probably at that moment in time, mean the world to them. Just to hear a friendly voice and knowing that someone has taken time out of their busy day to ask how you are can mean so very much"
I want to go home ??,Norrms,2022-07-25T09:22:17+0100,0,"I WANT TO GO HOME ??
How many times have you heard someone with dementia say, “I want to go home” It has to be one of the most common things that’s repeated many times by those with dementia when most of the time they are quite clearly still at home and have lived there for a very long time. And yet they still say it with that quizzical look in their eyes and a feeling of confusion. Those who are placed in care homes also say it, even when they have lived there for quite a while so the saying applies in many situations, but what does it mean?
As a person living with dementia and somebody who says the same thing (I am told by my wife) when I am “Sundowning” (an explanation about this will come later.) it’s something that’s puzzled me for a while and for what it’s worth, in my humble opinion, this is what I think it means. So, when I say I want to go home? Does this mean my birth town of Bolton in Lancashire? Well, as much I am so very proud of my Northern roots, and rightly so, I fell in love with Torquay the moment I arrived here over 25 years ago and may I say wild horses would not get me back up north, I really do believe Torquay is the best place in the world to live, so no, it’s not that.
Do I mean my spiritual home? Well, I am a roman catholic but a much lapsed one and sorry to say lost my faith years ago because of world and personal events. So, what do I mean when I look at my long suffering wife and say I want to go home?
 After much discussion with my wife who was a carer for over 30 years before she had to stop to look after me, we have come to this conclusion. “Home” is a place of safety, home is a place of reassurance and home is a peaceful place with no worries, no confusion and no troubles. When I ask to GO HOME Elaine always tells me all will be ok, holds my hand, reassures me that I am safe and makes me feel that all will be ok. I have always believed that no matter how poorly you are with dementia, no matter at what stages of it you are in with dementia, somewhere, deep down you know you are really ill, you know something is very very wrong and you know there is no cure. The worry of all that can become all too much at time, but can’t it for us all?
Doesn’t each one of us at some point feel like this, don’t we all need reassuring at times and be told that all will be ok, not to worry, or at least try not to. You see? People with dementia really are no different to anybody else, we really are all the same, and because some put us into that “Box” this is what feeds the stigma around it. Now I am not saying this is the correct explanation, and it is as I said, just my humble opinion, but it’s got to be worth a shot don’t you think? Because even if I am wrong, what harm can it do to reassure those with dementia? hold their hand and tell them try not to worry and they are loved so much by family and friends, I am sure it won’t do any harm and can only help them all.
Hope this helps xx"
Recently diagnosed,Robynrose,2022-08-27T04:11:17+0100,0,Eighteen months ago I moved back to Auckland NZ and into a retirement village. Around 2 months in I suffered a couple of black outs and my new GP ordered a brain scan. It showed I have frontotemporal dementia. I have to say for some time prior I felt something wasn't quite right however as I was caring for my extremely sick husband I ignored this. I can only stay at the village while I'm Independent. I feel blessed having found this message board as I don't feel so alone.
A Nowhere man,Norrms,2022-06-22T07:12:40+0100,0,"A NOWHERE Man 
This disease of dementia is the worst of diseases, with so many twists and turns, so unpredictable, and just when you think you have seen it all or felt it all, along comes another wave of what
dementia dishes out. And by this I mean??
Just lately I have not felt that well, I have been quiet, withdrawn and sullen, and as everyone who knows me this is totally opposite to who I am. I have spoken before about feeling lost but this is
different, I have been feeling as if I am not really here, does that sound really weird?? No?? Well I can tell you is does to me. I can see and hear all that’s going on around me, but it all sounds like a distant echo and I can’t seem to catch what’s being said properly, so frustrating. My spatial awareness is also much worse and this means I am shuffling or look as if I have had a drink when I
haven’t.
Is this my blood pressure? Or is it because I am too tired? I have always advocated that some use their illness as an easy excuse and as a GO TOO every time something’s wrong but I have never done
that. Some mornings I feel as if someone has put net curtains in front of my eyes and it’s so hard to see clearly. Now this is quite worrying because it’s the way I felt in the early stages of my dementia, also my words don’t come out as they should and I sound like I am stuttering which is also something that happened in the early days. All these things just to serve my fears that things are
getting worse, but yet, some days I can speak, see, walk properly and be my normal self, so as you  see there is no rhyme of reason to this disease for any of us with dementia. There is a very old saying in the “Dementia World” that states “When you have met one person with dementia, you have met ONE PERSON with dementia” and that’s why it’s so important that people understand it’s not all the same, it doesn’t play to the rules. If you get a cold or the flu we all know the symptoms’, but within dementia the symptoms are so very diverse I would be here all day explaining them all to you.
The Beatles once sang “He`s a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody” and as sad as that sounds, that`s what it feels like sometimes living with
this awful disease.
 The loneliness can be crippling and yet we have so many around us who love and care for us, that’s when the guilt monster comes to visit and you feel so guilty feeling like this and know you shouldn’t, and yet, try as you might to shake those feelings, you just can`t . These kind of feelings can last for days or just a few hours, nobody ever knows, but as I wake each day knowing I have this terminal disease, it’s never that far away from my thoughts, I still hope it’s just a blip and normal service will be resumed as soon as possible as they say. But we have to carry on don’t we??
Surely the easiest thing would be to give up and let nature take its course, wouldn’t it??
 But that’s not for me; I am a fighter and always will be, I will fight till the end, whenever that may come."

Not diagnosed just yet,Nonnajay,2022-08-04T10:24:55+0100,0,"Hello to all, (forgive me for this been long winded ) 

I am new to this forum but have been reading many of the posts. 

I am 48 years young and turned to my GP after a few years of not been myself . So he has been on this journey with me from the beggining and has seen the changes in me become worse over time. He believes I have Alzheimer’s and sent me to a neurologist who says I’m to young to have it and then had me do a test with another person in which he asked me questions and said things I had to remember and to drawl a clock which I have been able to do my whole life into he asked me. I burst into tears because I had forgotten how to do it. I didn’t remember barley any of the things he asked me to repeat and it was just not a good experience. (I don’t have the results from that as yet but I’m sure it wasn’t good ?) 

And then he sent me off for a mri a few months ago which came back clear except for the report said I have a basal ganglia calcification (I have no idea what that means) and it also said a possible iron disease. 

I haven’t spoken to him yet about that mri or the tests I had to do because I just keep forgetting to make that damn appointment to go back and see him. (My daughter is going to make the app for me tomorrow ❤️) 

So that’s the medical side . Now to about myself. 

Slowly I have gotten worse with everything not just my memory. I forget everything and I mean everything in minutes from what I just talked about to what day it is . I am always stopping in conversation because I cannot think of a word to use , I’m literally forgetting words ? and this makes me feel so degraded and so stupid and I don’t like been this way at a. Infact it’s not me, this is not who I was , I feel like someone else has entered my mind and is taking over and it’s the most scary feeling and the most devastating feeling . My young children (I have 8 children , four adult ones and four young ones ) but my children are constantly helping me with words , when I say the wrong things which is every time I talk. They shouldn’t have to be doing this for their mother . 

I say things that I completely don’t remember saying . I’m forgetting how to add numbers together and that’s something I was always very quick at doing , now I struggle if I can even do it . 

I can watch a tv show and by the next day it’s al forgotten and I’m latch it again and not remember a damn thing and my 12 year old will say mum we watched that last night together . 

I had to give up the course of my dreams that I waited to do till my youngest turned 9 and I had to give it up . I was starting to become a (omg I can’t remember  what it’s called ??, well a counselled but I don’t remember the name of it I’m sorry , and well I just want r able to remember the things I was reading and I wasn’t taking it all in like I should of been and I knew then something was REALLY wrong with me so I was so heart broken I waited 30 years and then didn’t get to become a counselled after all that time .

I’m losing myself , I’m forget isn’t what my grandchild names are and calling them other random names and they live with me ?

I’m feel more and more I’m been oh she’s to the background. While this imposter takes over my brain and is taking away my once amazing memory . And yet I am starting to remember things from my past way better then ever before . It’s just so strange . 

I don’t know if this sounds like Alzheimer’s but my doctor said he is pretty sure it’s early onset . But the neuro practically scoffed at the thought of it been that . But I know this ain’t me and I’m deteriorating slowly. It’s not MY mind anymore and I’m losing myself more and more . 

I’m sorry for the long rant if you got this far , but I feel so alone and no one understands how isolating this feels so I found you all in this forum. 

Does anyone know if any of this is a Alzheimer’s or dementia signs? Please be honest with me 


Love and light

All you wanted to know but they dont tell you,Norrms,2022-05-30T08:58:03+0100,0,"These are the things YOU always wanted to know about dementia, but THEY were too AFRAID TO TELL YOU,
Norrms (Living With dementia myself)

Those with dementia MAY, and I have to STRESS, “MAY” show some of these symptoms

1. Confusion and repeated questions are very common, please remember they are not doing this to “WIND YOU UP” Every time they ask the question it is the very first time they have asked it, according to them.

2. Swearing and Anger, even though they may have never have sworn in their life, they have heard people swear many many times during their lifetime, they know the words and are very familiar with them, so don’t be so shocked, this may be a form of release because their inhibitions have changed.

3. Inhibitions, talking of which, some may start to walk around completely naked in front of others with no conscience whatsoever, they may also start to speak their mind and say exactly what they are thinking and feeling. They may be a lot sharper in tone, than usual, and lose their temper so quickly, all born out of frustration.

4. Violence, is a very tricky one but has to be spoken about, even the mildest mannered of people MAY lash out at loved ones and strangers at times, they may bite, scratch, nip punch, spit at you, kick out, or worse, please remember it’s not them, but the disease.

5. Incontinence, believe it or not SO MANY Drs etc DO NOT talk about this when giving a diagnosis, yes it does happen to all, but to those it does, it has a HUGE effect on everyday life. Always starts with small accidents, small damp patches etc and increases. Please remember the signal from the Bowel./ the bladder has been disrupted and cant tell the brain when they need to pee or poo. In all honesty, if they KNEW what was happening they would be MORTIFIED as would you, SO NO NEED TO CHASTISE AT ALL !!

6. Frustration, Imagine KNOWING you have this disease as in Lewy bodies and KNOWING there is no cure, no remedies, and the chance is, you will forget ALL that you hold dear but you can do absolutely NOTHING about it. ?? Wanting to scream and shout is a huge understatement and why it often happens for no apparent reason.

7. Speech, the loss of coherent speech is so familiar in some people with dementia, one of the most common is having a conversation with you that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to you, but please remember, it does to them, and please also REMEMBER THIS, if you listen to them very carefully, sometimes, just sometimes you will hear the word “Thirsty” “Hungry” or “Painful ” repeated. This could help you understand a little more.

8. OUTBURSTS, A very important one, this can be caused by noise, or life, in general, being so busy around them, supermarkets shops etc, the volume of peoples voices is sometimes magnified a thousand times to people with dementia so its sounds absolutely deafening causing the person with dementia to shout SHUTUP !! Or worse !! Sometimes causing them to RUN out of the shop and try and escape to only they know where.

9. Wandering, The MOST important thing to remember is, that people with dementia never ever get lost!!! THEY know EXACTLY where they are going!! They just haven’t told you !!! They will often try all sorts of tricks to get out of the house, and please don’t be fooled into thinking because of their age or frailty they cant get far. NO ONE KNOWS where they get the strength from to walk such distances but they can, and please don’t forget they have bus passes and can use them. We had a lady from Torbay who was found in Scunthorpe thanks to her bus pass, never EVER underestimate those with dementia.

10. Hallucinations, Hallucinations are NOT DREAMS or NIGHT TERRORS lets get that out of the way first.
Hallucinations are usually connected with those who have Lewy Body, but people with Alzheimer’s and particularly vascular dementia because of lack of oxygen to the brain will, or may suffer from these (I will NOT apologise for using the word suffering because if anybody has them like i myself do believe me they are suffering!!) Day or night these can happen, it may, to you, like they are talking to themselves or wanting to chase people, in some cases they will kick and punch as if shadowboxing, you will not be able to see who they are doing this to? But believe me, it is so VERY REAL to them.

11. NIGHT TERRORS, Imagine your worst fear being played out right in front of your eyes, imagine the horror unfolding in front of you, piercing screams, grotesque faces, and being`s, clawing at you, biting you, then multiply this by 100,000! and you have a night terror. Also, imagine not being able to wake from this as it seems neverending.
Then imagine this happening every 30 mins of every night of every week? Hard I know but this is how bad it can get.

12. Feelings. This is a tough one, but I have seen with my very own eyes the hurt it brings when you may visit a loved one and they are holding hands, or have arms wrapped around a complete stranger in a care setting and don’t recognize you. You may well have been with this person a LIFETIME but please beware, this happens more regularly than some places care to admit.

13. Spatial awareness Is the person stumbling? Staggering like they are drunk for no apparent reason? Do the FALL “Upstairs” or downstairs? Banging their toes on doors, beds, etc? Are they missing the step down on the pavement, or more importantly walking into the road with no fear of oncoming Traffic?? This is because what you see they don’t, once again the signal from the eyes to the brain is distorted and wavey, this cause to see things very differently and miss the most important bits, very similar to having blind spots for all you drivers out there.

14. LOSS of APPETITE ?? or NOT ?? because of that signal (ONCE AGAIN) to the brain from the stomach and eyes not working properly some with Dementia may want to eat more as they have forgotten they have just had their meal. “What if they eat a lot? I hear you cry? “They must feel full I hear you say” but HOW can they feel full if the signals not working and they still feel starving ?? So you see, not their fault, they are not at fault at all because of this awful disease. Then there is the quandry of those not eating or drinking enough. this can be caused by many things but sometimes it really is just a case of putting water into a yellow cup or container, placing a small meal on a yellow plate instead of white, and doing the same with tea and coffee. People with dementia can sometimes see right through clear glasses and don’t see what's in front of them, we have proof this works on our other website.

15. Sundowning !!! And LAST but Certainly not LEAST? SUNDOWNING !! I would personally put this on the school curriculum if I had the chance !! Sundowning is easier to understand than you think, it does exactly what it says on the tin !! AS the sun goes down the person with dementia gets worse, becomes more confused, more agitated, and more frustrated, it really is as simple as that !! And what is, even more, simpler to help you and others including professionals, is to, QUITE SIMPLY change all their appointments with Drs, dentists, podiatrists, consultants, etc, to MORNING Appointments so the person with dementia is in a better place, it a lots easier on you to manage and the Drs etc don’t have a hard time treating then either, you see? It’s not that difficult, is it?





These are just 15 points of what you MAY come to expect after a diagnosis of dementia, WHY don’t they tell you this? and WHY has it taken so long to be told this? especially by a person who is LIVING with this disease ?? I have NO IDEA !!
But what I do hope is you all read this, share this, copy and paste this and print it out and put it in every Drs surgery in the UK /World for all to see, it’s not a state secret, and those who don’t want to know won’t read it"
Is there ever a right time ?,Norrms,2022-05-14T08:53:49+0100,0,"Is There Ever A Right Time With Dementia,


Over the last few weeks I have been saddened to read some blogs from carers across the world where they say things about a loved ones with dementia  like “Do they know they are lying ? “Are they doing it just to wind me up? And more worryingly “ my husband has just ordered this, or that, or taken money out of the bank, which made me think, when is the right time to step in and gain lasting power of attorney ? It’s a tough one isn’t it?


One example, extreme it may be, but a true one, of someone who didn’t, and it ended in her losing her house, her savings and her husband immigrating to Australia with the lot leaving her destitute!! How did that happen I hear you ask, but when we don’t step in these things can happen as he thought he had no illness at all, even though all around him quite clearly knew he had dementia and in his own mind he wasn’t married, and was going back to where he was born down under, but because nothing was put in place by the time he had signed all the relevant documents it was to late. Sadly a true story and so sad to say the gent passed away shortly after in Australia leaving no will. As you will see at the beginning of this I mentioned “Lasting Power Of Attorney and not Power of Attorney, a huge difference and I would always advise the lasting power of attorney, please look it up.


When I was first diagnosed I sat with my family and explained all, best thing I ever did, and then one night my wife and I sat and chatted about the future and we just knew we had to put our house in order as they say. So our “WILL” was checked and any adjustments necessary was made including where I was to be buried in case I started to say I wanted to back up north where I was born. Then it came to lasting power of attorney. Personally I had no problem letting my wife take over looking after things as she had more or less been doing that for years, but in a strange way this secured our future, and yes it’s a matter of trust, but in my humble opinion if you don’t have trust then why are you married?? 
We still do the same things, spend the same money etc. and nothing feels as if it has changed, but my point being is,  if I started to change, revert to my single days before I met Elaine then it could have had disastrous results.

 Lasting Power of Attorney is a safeguard; you have to make sure that as many obstacles that could be in your way are removed, it’s hard enough trying to negotiate the path of the dementia illness without added pressure.


Of course this really all boils down to one thing, and that is early diagnosis, as early as possible, so then whilst not being badly cognitively impaired at the beginning you cans rest assured that you have most things covered.

I am interested if those carers for PWD who are now aphasic recognise this as the start of non-verbalisation?"
Concerned,MrsTiggywinkle,2021-11-14T22:30:26+0000,0,"Hello everyone,
I thought I would join this forum and introduce myself.   I do not have a diagnosis but I wanted to ask if any of the follo, Hwing experiences sound familiar.

Today I had trouble using a tin opener and was trying to catch the rim of the can between the little wheels but it wasn't working. My daughter and husband were there and my daughter said she would do it. I had forgotten that the type of can opener it is works by putting it flat on the top of the tin. We have had this can opener for years. Of course so many tins have a ring pull now, I hadn't used it for a while. 

Recently I have had a couple of occasions when I have not realised where I was, or how to get out of a car park I had been in several times before. Both times my passenger at the time wondered what the matter was (one or other of my adult children). I said it was because it was dark. 

It is very common for me to forget words, or the names of family members. There is a short silence while I think of it. Another thing that happens all the time is that my husband or one of my daughters tells me that they have told me something before and I really have no recollection. Also I mentioned Stephen Hawking in a conversation recently and my daughter said 'Mum he died several years ago'. Really? 

About 3 years ago I went to the doctor about word finding difficulties and also misspelling words which is very unusual for me. Also saying the wrong word. I had an MRI which was normal and an appointment with a neurologist where he asked me to say as many words beginning with P and other things like that He said my results were average.

I have had a lot of stress in my life for some years now and someone told me that the problem with words and language may be down to that. I don't misspell things as much as I used to but I have had these other problems. Stalling the car on a roundabout several times is another thing I have done. Also falling upstairs! 

I am sorry this is so long. I suppose I should go back to the doctor but I am thinking I'd rather see if things get worse.

The psychiatric nurse has not noticed this, and even though I've mentioned it, nothing happens. I have mentioned that maybe the long term use of Risperidone is not helping mum.

If I am lucky I could live another five to  ten years... I am just 65 yrs old.  I knew I have a problem ie confusion and forgetfulness but I am shocked  by the early death diagnosis. I had asked to be assessed by the NHS memory clinic two year ago as my husband and I believed that something had changed and I had a memory problem, the memory clinic did a face to face question and answer type assessment and  told us my memory was in  a normal range, and there was nothing to worry about, memory naturally declines as you get older.
 I was assessed ( a paper question and answer form and a short interview by two specialist nurses .After their assessment I was told I have a very slight cognitive impairment which was normal at my age.
Both me and my husband  and eventually my GP believed it was more than that. My GP eventually referred me to the to  hospital to see a specialist . He listened  carefully to us and organised a urgent lumber punch ,which confirmed i did indeed have quite advanced Alzheimer's.

Yesterday's meeting With DSCAG (Adult social care group),Norrms,2022-04-27T08:56:51+0100,0,"FEEDBACK FROM YESTERDAY`S TWO HOUR ZOOM MEETING

Good morning all, well, where do I start apart from an apology for the long (ish) feedback.

All through my life I have always regarded myself as someone who likes to achieve, follow-through, and then see a positive outcome, and I am no different now, dementia or not. I have chaired and sat in so many meetings and after every one of them, I have always thought about it overnight and thought ""What did we achieve today?

I woke this morning, and, after thinking long and hard about yesterday's meeting I came to the conclusion ""ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! 

My worst fears came true, it was slide after slide of data and three presentations with some goals set, but nobody asked
""So, what are we going to do about it??


Well apart from when I explained that two of their ideas were like reinventing the wheel and another was just using new tech for techs sake, you can imagine how that went down!! I imagine by the reaction it fell on deaf ears. I myself, was headed as an Expert By Experience, which I think is patronising as I am certainly no EXPERT in the sense of the word and as I was the only one there with a diagnosis of dementia?  I am convinced it was a tick boxing exercise by the organisers .

The saddest thing was out of the 40 or so who attended I would bet any money that only a handful and by that I mean five, had ever actually worked in care, on the floor in care homes as a carer !!  and even worse,? they have 150 Million YES 150 Million £s to spare to improve care in Adult and social care ERRR PHEW!! If i could use just a tiny bit of that for MP3s we would be laughing LOL
The next meeting is in three months' time (Every Quater) but so disappointingly no mention of ""What we want to achieve before next meeting was mentioned, no goals set and no deadlines to action?? So in all honesty ""What's the point? Will, I attend the next meeting ?? The jury's out on that one but as always will  let you know

The Man with the Child in his Eyes

This Kate Bush song always reminds me of my dementia, probably because I have never grown up, nor do I want to loll. I always tell my grandchildren “Please don’t grow up, it’s a CON!! But personally speaking and according to all I know I still have that child in my eyes, I`m still like a child inside and if I am very honest I like it that way. I am far too old to change now. It’s not my dementia as I know so many who are in their 60s and still think they are 21 and there’s nothing wrong with that, even if it’s just the spirit that’s willing.

But I DO believe it has helped with my dementia as I tend to look at things as I would if I really was 21! I have always been an optimist and looked on the bright side. A famous saying in our house is “out of something bad always comes something good, as I am always reminded by Elaine my wife. Looking at life the way I do, I really do believed it has helped me get through the toughest times and with the help of my family as well, it’s a great combination.

When I was first diagnosed I went to a very dark place, and thought at the age of 53 my life was over, but my beautiful wife sat me down and said to me “Mc Namara? You have two choices, you can sit there, feel sorry for self and give up, or you can stand up, put your boots on and not your slippers and come out fighting!! Thankfully I listened and because of that I am totally convinced that’s the reason why I am here now writing this.

I have to say I am the first to admit not everybody can do this, and have lost count the amount of times I have broken down when I have heard of someone passing away with dementia after only a couple of years or so and it still affects me now I am not ashamed to say. But, that only spurs me on to try and help others where we can to live a longer and as best life as they can,. I have many friends across the world who have lived with dementia a lot longer than me, some 15 years and some 20+years, but one thing we do have in common is being outspoken on the world stage across the globe trying to share how we feel, how dementia affects us and how we try and manage even through the Hardest times.

I believe we all have that child in our eyes as we get older, after all, who doesn’t laugh at silly things sometimes and long may it last, whoever, wherever, you are

Dementia- Its the illness not the person,Norrms,2022-03-27T11:37:14+0100,0,"DEMENTIA- IT’S THE ILLNESS, NOT THE PERSON

At home yesterday because of illness,, whilst all were at memory café, it gave me time to think about things, not often I get a little time alone with my thoughts, and yes there were plenty of tears as well as smiles. If my psychologist was sat with me I should think I would have been admitted by now but happily she wasn’t and I am here to tell the tale so to speak lol. Admittedly many bad things came to mind, the night terrors, the hallucinations, the acts of myself that’s totally out of character and the anguish an pain this disease has brought my loved ones.
I refuse to say it’s what I have brought on because it’s not, it’s the illness, never in a million years would I act sometimes as I do and this is something I want to concentrate on in this short blog. YES ! I feel responsible for everything I do and say, but I cannot and will not try to forget that it’s not really me saying these things and doing something’s sometimes which I would, in pre dementia life ever do, I only wish others would remember that too.
I write for and advise on many forums across the world and one of the most common threads appearing is, Why does HE/SHE do this, Is HE/SHE doing this on purpose? Do “THEY “ know what they are doing when they say/do these awful things?? And most of all, DO THEY DO THIS JUST TO WIND ME UP?? All of these things need to addressed can be quite simply with the answer of NO. If someone has a diagnoses of dementia and I have to stress the “ Have “ a diagnosis of dementia no matter what type (in my case Lewy Bodys), or we go into a very grey area of quite simply behaving badly and being downright rude. Once diagnosed, admittedly it’s like a ticking time bomb; nobody can tell you exactly what’s going to happen as everybody is so different. Some go really quiet, some get louder and louder (No comment lol )  some, sadly, become violent and more aggressive and some not, but the one thing I would advise is , well, two actually, is firstly >>>>>>
Cast your mind back before the dementia come along, would he / she have acted like this?? Would they have been so awkward, so loud, so “Shouty , if there is such a word, or so rude?? I am betting the answer is NO and so there is your answer, it’s the ILLNESS and not the person, so please please, as hard as it is, try to remember this.
The second thing to remember is nobody but nobody is going to knock on your door and tell you the truth about what can happen when someone has dementia, absolutely nobody, as believe it or not it’s stil,l even in this day and age, something that’s whispered about in certain countries. You!! yes YOU have to go out there and find all this out, no it’s not fair, and no its shouldn’t be that way but sadly it is, but as they say you wouldn’t go to war without knowing your enemy would you !! Which, is quite apt in this day and age.
I hope this piece has helped and always remember the Purple Angel campaign is always here to help you no matter where you are in the world, dementia knows no boundaries, then why should, we ??

Truth About Lewy Bodys dementia,Norrms,2022-02-18T10:14:53+0000,0,"The Truth about Lewy Body’s dementia
My nights are getting worse, there I have said it. I have waited a couple of weeks in the hope it was just a blip, but no, continuous night after night terrors and hallucinations haunt me. They have also intensified in-depth as I call it and I will not put you through the horror of telling you in detail what I see and hear because I see and hear things no other human being should ever do, the screams the visions, and scenes playing out in front of my eyes every night also haunt me daily and flashbacks can appear in front of my eyes at any time. I dread going to bed, my eyes are heavy and some nights I try to fight it, but to no avail, and as soon as I close my eyes and drift off it’s as if someone has switched the TV on without my permission and forcing me to watch whatever unfolds, no matter how horrific, no matter how bloody and gross it is, I only come round when the devil that is Lewy Bodies lets me, I have no control at all over this.
I have tried many serious and heavy medicines to try and stop this but to no avail. The more serious being very strong to help me sleep but all they do is put me so far under that any chance of waking up to normality is nigh on impossible and no matter how many I have tried, and there have been so many none works. As yet I have yet to hear about medicine that stops you from having Night terrors, nightmares, or dreams. But it’s the tiredness and flashbacks that`s the real killer. 


When I was first diagnosed I vowed to learn as much as I could about it, I mean, you wouldn’t go to war without knowing your enemy, would you? And after learning what I have it all starts to fall into place, the reason being, I, like many others will not talk about the night terrors or hallucinations in detail for fear of frightening people to death, so we keep it all in, but with that comes the tiredness. I have found myself rising about 8am but quite capable of falling asleep at noon, and then again about 4pm before being taken to bed anytime between 8pm onwards. Does this explain why so many with dementia start to sleep longer and at unusual times of the day??
Question? How do you cope with this ?????

This is something I am asked many times, and it would be so easy to say because I am a northerner, stubborn, and as singe minded and awkward as they come!!
 But my usual answer is…..

“” When I get up in the morning I put my boots on and not my slippers!!!!


But truth be known I would have to say day by day and sometimes hour by hour, some days I ache I am so exhausted, some days not, some days I can put a huge smile on and meet all at the memory Cafe with so much energy and enthusiasm, some days I cannot and on other days I just want to sit in reclining chair and sleep, such is the evil of the beast. Yes, it would have to be taking day by day. I worry about what’s to become of me, I have seen the last stages in so many across the years including within my own family. I am grateful, so grateful I have managed to do what I have for so long, but I would never apologise for it, even though there are times I feel so guilty when I see those much farther down the line than me that have been diagnosed a short time.
So what of the FUTURE??
Honestly?? I have no idea as I have always believed no one can predict what’s to come, and if I had any advice to anybody just diagnosed, it would be to learn all you can about it, it has put my mind at rest so many times, and take every day as a bonus, life is for living, it’s not a rehearsal and you only get one go at it so enjoy I whilst you can.

Compassionate Communication with the Memory Impaired

by Liz Ayres
A Volunteer of the Alzheimer's Association and Former Caregiver

DON'T
Don’t reason.
Don’t argue.
Don’t confront.
Don’t remind them they forget.
Don’t question recent memory.
Don’t take it personally.



DO
Give short, one sentence explanations.
Allow plenty of time for comprehension, then triple it.
Repeat instructions or sentences exactly the same way.
Eliminate 'but' from your vocabulary; substitute 'nevertheless.'
Avoid insistence. Try again later
Agree with them or distract them to a different subject or activity
Accept blame when something’s wrong (even if it’s fantasy).
Leave the room, if necessary, to avoid confrontations.
Respond to feelings rather than words
Be patient and cheerful and reassuring. Do go with the flow.
Practice 100% forgiveness. Memory loss progresses daily.
My appeal to you: Please.elevate your level of generosity and graciousness.



Remember

You can’t control memory loss, only your reaction to it. Compassionate communication will significantly heighten quality of life.

They are not crazy or lazy. They say normal things, and do normal things, for a memory impaired, dementia individual. If they were deliberately trying to exasperate you, they would have a different diagnosis. Forgive them ... always. For example: they don’t hide things; they protect them in safe places... And then forget. Don’t take ‘stealing’ accusations personally.

Their disability is memory loss. Asking them to remember is like asking a blind person to read. (“Did you take your pills?” “What did you do today?”) Don’t ask and don’t test memory! A loss of this magnitude reduces the capacity to reason. Expecting them to be reasonable or to accept your conclusion is unrealistic. (“You need a shower.” “Day care will be fun.” “You can’t live alone.”) Don’t try to reason or convince them. Give a one sentence explanation or search for creative solutions. Memory loss produces unpredictable emotions, thought, and behavior, which you can alleviate by resolving all issues peacefully. Don’t argue, correct, contradict, confront, blame, or insist.

Reminders are rarely kind. They tell the patient how disabled they are – over and over again. Reminders of the recent past imply, “I remember, I’m okay; you don’t, you’re not. ”Ouch! Refer to the present or the future. (If they’re hungry, don’t inform them they ate an hour ago, offer a snack or set a time to eat soon.) They may ask the same question repeatedly, believing each time is the first. Graciously respond as if it’s the first time. Some days may seem normal, but they are not. They live in a different reality. Reminders won’t bring them into yours. Note: For vascular dementia, giving clues may help their recall. If it doesn’t work, be kind ... don’t remind.

Ethical dilemmas may occur. If, for instance, the patient thinks a dead spouse is alive, and truthful reminders will create sadness, what should you do? To avoid distress, try these ways of kindness: 1) distract to another topic, or 2) start a fun activity, or 3) reminisce about their spouse, “I was just thinking about ______. How did you two meet?” You might even try, “He’s gone for a while. Let’s take our walk now.”

Open-ended questions (“Where shall we go?” “What do you want to eat/wear/do?”) are surprisingly complex and create anxiety. Give them a simple choice between two items or direct their choice, “You look great in the red blouse.”

They are scared all the time. Each patient reacts differently to fear. They may become passive, uncooperative, hostile, angry, agitated, verbally abusive, or physically combative. They may even do them all at different times, or alternate between them. Anxiety may compel them to shadow you (follow everywhere). Anxiety compels them to resist changes in routine, even pleasant ones. Your goal is to reduce anxiety whenever possible. Also, they can’t remember your reassurances. Keep saying them.

Examples

Don’t reason

Patient What doctor’s appointment? There’s nothing wrong with me.”
Don’t (reason) “You’ve been seeing the doctor every three months for the last two years. It’s written on the calendar and I told you about it yesterday and this morning.”
DO (short explanation) “It’s just a regular check-up.”

Thanks so much for your share.  I have Terminal Brain Disease.  I can’t find any support here. The only posts I see are how horrible we are. Then the next post is how much worse their We is compared to your We. Where’s my support?  I came here because it said it’s a support group."
I don't have dementia,WJG,2021-05-07T09:58:08+0100,0,"Dementia, we are told, is a syndrome. A description of a state of dependence. I don't have it, and nor do most of the other folk I know with progressive brain diseases. We may, of course, one day.

And yet we use 'dementia' services, and here is this topic named 'I have dementia'. I would live to change the D word. I think it's unhelpful and outmoded. It describes people with the more severe symptoms of illness, and does a disservice to those of us with the earlier stages. But this seems to be a losing battle - everywhere I look people use 'dementia' to encompass everyone with Alzheimer's and other neuro degenerative conditions."
Mini mental test-Is it fit for purpose,Norrms,2022-01-03T10:21:31+0000,0,"Dementia-Mini Mental Test-Is It Fit For Purpose?

The mini mental test you are asked when you have been referred to the Consultant by your doctor is

“probably “ one of the most important tests of your cognitive abilities and memory tests, but is it fit

for purpose? Dementia is predominantly about short term memory loss, please remember these

four words SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS and yet during the tests you are asked these kind of

question’s



Q? Where do you live? Ans? Well, you may have lived at the same house for the last forty years!!

Q? Who is the queen of England ? Ans? Really? Oh come on!! She has been on the throne for 70 yrs

plus

Q? What car do you drive? Ans ? You may well have had the same car for years



And best of all? Q? Please draw a triangle inside a triangle and a circle overlapping a circle.



Now, if you’re anything like me the only thing I can draw is breath!! Dementia or not, I would

struggle with that one and so it goes on, in my humble opinion? Absolutely ridiculous! A perfect

example is a very good friend of mine who also had severe dementia went to do the test with his

wife; he scored 17 out of twenty and was told it wasn’t too bad and progressing slowly. They both

left the building got in the car, drove 1 mile home and when they arrived home his wife asked him

“Where have we just been? He answered “No idea!! At this point I should be saying I rest my case!!

But I won’t because I really don’t think the Doctors or Consultants are listening enough the loved

ones and relatives and they really need too.

Now i know what you’re thinking? What should they be asking then?? Well, here are a few

suggestions I believe every loved one should ask the consultant to ask, in fact INSIST the consultant



asks these questions because after all, it’s about SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS , remember ? (See

what I did there?) They should ask?

Q? How did you get here this morning?

Q? What did you have for breakfast?

Q? What time did you get up??



Q? What did you watch on TV last night?

We need relevant questions to be asked and not the same ones that have been asked for years, they

are clearly not working as so many are being missed and going undiagnosed. When I was first

diagnosed I was told by consultant to “Use it or Lose it, that was all” When I asked him after all his

years of experience, and in his professional capacity, was that the best advice he could give?? I will

let you guess his response, needless to say I changed consultant and it’s a good job I did as the first

one diagnosed me the Alzheimer’s Type dementia and I actually had the Lewy body’s type dementia,

and I really can’t stress enough how important it is to get the right diagnosis, as different drugs for

different types of dementia are involved and wrong usage of certain drugs can have dire

consequences, if you have any doubt whatsoever please insist on either a second opinion.

So if you do find yourself in the awful position of being sat there whilst a loved one is being

diagnosed for dementia and they do the mini mental test, please insist the questions I have

suggested be asked, they will help ensure the consultant has a better idea of how far the disease has

progressed"

Another weird day,Dunroamin,2020-11-14T14:14:11+0000,0,"I attended the dental surgery recently and was left upset and confused for several days.  Whilst there I did not know what was happening, could not understand what was being said (I acknowledge I lip read a lot normally) and generally felt totally discombobulated.  On returning home  I was apparently aimless and confused for a  quite a while.  This included (apparently) me adding washing sanitiser to a cup of tea instead of milk which I had previously put back in the fridge.  I   then slept for over 24 hours.  My brain seemed to  recover somewhat and on waking I felt more like me and able to more or less cope with everyday life again.

So basically out of my normal environment and routine I do not seem to cope.  For someone who has always relished change and  challenges this is an unwelcome (and inevitable) situation.  I was also recently given n Autumn activity pack by a volunteer for people like myself and it brought home to me what the expectations of others are for someone with Alzheimers.   Colouring packs, word search and so on.  Very well meaning, but merely reinforcing  my sense of increasing bereavement at what I am slowly losing.  I can no longer understand scientific papers, read music, interpret graphs and other activities that I was more than capable of taking part in.  My attention span is decreasing.  I also have a great sense of guilt that my husband, with his failing vision, is coping with, and for the future.  As a retired health professional I know more than most what is in store.

Apologies, just needed to offload I suppose.  Who would have thought I completed a Marathon last month   ?"

When loved ones become strangers,Norrms,2022-01-20T08:22:21+0000,0,"WHEN LOVED ONES BECOME STRANGERS


Here’s something that happens so very often but is not spoken about that much, and that’s when loved ones become strangers because of dementia. But i believe it should be, In wider circles, to help those left behind understand they are not on their own in this.


Imagine this? Being married to someone for 30/40/50 years +, and then one day they look straight through you as you would a stranger passing by and have absolutely no idea who you are? Or even worse they call you by someone else’s name and treat you like an acquaintance. All you have built together, all you have celebrated and lamented, all you every talked about, your hopes, your dreams, your memories you have shared together, all gone? Can we even begin to imagine how devastating that would be for the loved one left behind? And yet thousands of people go through this every year and mostly in private, to ashamed to tell others and thinking its only happening to them.


The saddest thing is, it’s not talked about enough, not shared on social media or spoken about in support meetings? Why not?? Please don’t get me wrong, there is a time and place for everything and I am not advocating inundate them with all the horrors that comes with dementia all at once, but I do believe I being prepared and along the road the family walk after a loved one has had a diagnosis this should be gently brought up and discussed as a possibility. I am a firm believer that somewhere, deep down is the same person and always will be, I have said so many times there isn’t a Dr on the planet that can tell what those with dementia are thinking, especially in later stages; don’t we sometimes wish we could? But not possible, but why they forget loved ones and close family is certainly a mystery, but the truth is it happens, and unless we drag the effects of this awful disease screaming and kicking into the 21st century and lay it bare for all to see, we will not be able to help others understand the complexities of this awful disease

I have dementia, it’s a terminal disease, I am slowly dying and disappearing right in front of my families eyes, bit by bit each and every day. They say a cure could be 10 to 20 years away from now, too late for me. I have dementia but I am not daft!! I lost my Father and wonderful grandmother to this awful disease so I know what my future holds. I wake each and every night, screaming and shouting, fighting enemies who are completely invisible to anybody else.


I hear my mum shout my name, I see and feel my dog slide up to me on the settee, Both  have been dead for years!! I’ve seen myself walk out of a lift whilst sitting facing in a cafe, and I have felt myself dying in bed trying to call my “Angel” Elaine’s name to tell her I love her before I do. I look into my children’s eyes and wonder who they are about to become, how they will manage, and who will stand guard over them all as I have done for so many years.


Even after all these years I still come across so called “Friends” who cross the road from me now rather than say hello because they think it might be contagious !! I have to be held by the hand at all times as I have lost all my road sense and would walk straight in front of a car in an instant!!


Most days I disappear into a world of my own. I used to say nothing bad ever happened in my world, now sometimes, it seems totally opposite. I want to scream and shout sometimes, but I know if I do, that people will look at me and think AWWWWW, must be his Dementia!!! The slightest thing that goes wrong and it’s the end of the world as far as I am concerned. Things I used to take in my stride are now totally devastating, and yet???


I smile, we smile, we all smile, through thick and thin we smile. We go out, into the big bad world, every day and try to make people understand why I, and others feel like this and why this disease makes you feel as if you are the loneliest person in the world, even though you are surrounded by love. Why do we smile and go out there every day? Because we are born to fight!! We are genetically made up to fend off all that is thrown at us and make the best of what we have!! Where we get the strength from? Nobody knows, but somehow, we get up in the mornings day after day and face head on whatever is thrown at us!!


WHY DO WE ALL DO THIS DAY AFTER DAY?


Because we have hope!! Because we hope one day all will be well or at least be a little better tomorrow than today and that is enough for us to hold onto. That little bit of hope is enough to feed our soul, help us breath, speak our words and have our voices heard, just that little bit of hope can do so much. So please my friends, whatever situation you are in, whatever your health may be like, please hold on tight to that little bit of hope, because, even something so small, that can’t be seen, touched, tasted, heard or smelt, can bring a little happiness to each and every heart in the world!!

Showers and baths - a PWD's perspective,Dunroamin,2022-01-18T11:17:05+0000,0,"Showers: 
the water never seems to be right and I struggle with the settings. The water stings my eyes and I become tense and irritable.   It gets lovely and warm in the shower but it is so very cold and unfriendly when I get out.  I cannot wait to get dressed so often do not dry myself properly.  The shower door is painful when I knock into it when unsteady and it is hard to be actually helped

Baths:

The water temperature is always just right (OH bought a thermometer)  The whole room is warm so I don't mind getting out.  The water is relaxing and I can rest there for a while making no demands on anyone.  We let the water out, wrap me in warm  towels and I am helped out.  I am relaxed and stress free.

Note: this is a woman who cold swims in the open air, so not averse to the cold.  its just showers at home i HATE and I realise not all actually have a bath or are able to use one if they have."
Dementia and Covid,Norrms,2022-01-14T14:59:51+0000,0,"The other day I was talking to a friend of mine I hadn’t seen for years. I knew

they had lost a loved one because of dementia during the lockdowns of Covid

but it was only really brought home to me by their vivid explanation of how

bad it was. Sadly the wonderful carers out there can only do so much and as

hard as it is sometimes they have to put their loved ones into care for their

own health and wellbeing as well as those with the illness, as this was the case.

But when you place you’re loved in care you would never expect a Pandemic to

come along and stop you from seeing them.

It was explained to me the horror of only being able to see your loved one,

only through a window and watch them slowly disappear into the grip of

dementia, and mostly because of lack of communication, contact with loved

ones and interaction. Listening to this got me thinking about how many more

with dementia had suffered the same fate during the lockdowns. Interaction

and communication is so important in all our lives and without it loneliness

sets in, which, if I had my way, loneliness would be recognised as a medical

condition.

The figures we hear about are always about COVID but what about those who

have been placed into homes and have lost the personal care of a loved one

which is bad enough, but also all forms of communication? I have no words,

it’s so incredibly sad, and sadly I have no answers apart from suggesting using

today’s technology where possible, where you can talk and video via Smart

phones, laptops etc

I cannot begin to imagine the loneliness and confusion felt by someone being placed into strange surroundings then being left to build relations themselves without their loved ones by their side and dementia breathing down their neck.

18/22 on remote MoCa test,MamarC,2022-01-12T17:38:44+0000,0,Hi I have an mri of head due this Saturday and have just got copy of the clinic letter after my initial telephone assessment. In the letter it says I scored 3.75 on the ‘Short IQCODE’ and 18/22 on the remote MoCa. I of course immediately googled it and I think it indicates a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment which will be a relief as I think I can improve with lifestyle changes (less stress) and does not always lead to full blown dementia. I wondered if anyone on here had a similar score and what it meant for them. I’m currently not driving  as I can’t trust my concentration and I’ve had a couple of times I can’t recognise where I am even tho I’m in a familiar place.  I have also woke up confused a couple of times.  I’m also in process of selling my business as I just can’t concentrate properly and everything is taking me twice as long to do in the office ?‍♀️  I’d love to hear from anyone else with this diagnosis (Altho I realise it isn’t my diagnosis until I’ve had the scan and face to face consultation) cx
Welcome to my world of dementia,Norrms,2022-01-05T09:48:29+0000,0,"WELCOME TO MY WORLD OF DEMENTIA



Please, step this way and i will try and show you what it's really like to have dementia.



Oops! Mind your step please, that's what we call spatial awareness, what that means is sometimes you don't always see what's in front of you and tend to miss the steps going up or coming down so be careful. Pardon? You can't see properly? Does it feel like you have net curtains in front of your eyes? Yes, well that's perfectly normal for those with dementia, looking out on life seems so distorted sometimes, just dementia playing tricks on you. Please take a seat, OH OH ! Be careful you nearly missed the seat then, make sure it's right behind you before you sit as it can sometimes seem nearer than you think.



Would you like a drink ? There you go, a nice glass of cool water, sorry? You can't see it? Oh, I am so sorry, what was I thinking? that's because I have put it in a clear glass, here you go, it's in a nice coloured vessel now, is that easier to see? I am so pleased. What? Who's that at the window?? Oh please don't worry, it's probably dementia playing its tricks on you, come on let's go out for a bit of something to eat. Here you are, here's your coat, please don't worry you will find the arms soon, i will help, there you go! It doesn't matter how long it takes we will get there. 



There you go, all inside the car, please put your seat belt on, Sorry? Hang on i will get out and put it on for you, it’s a bit of a BUG***R this dementia aint it? There you go, that's better, off we go.

WHOA!!! That’s the door handle not the window, please don't open that if you can remember, i know its hard. I am so pleased you feel better getting out and about, and i know how much you like watching the world go by, let’s have a drive over the moors before we go to town. Yes, it’s beautiful isn't it? The moors just go on forever, what? You feel as if you can breathe easier and see better out here, well that's wonderful, let’s go and get some lunch in town.



Here we go, wait!! Please wait until i stop the car before you get out and please stay on the pavement till we cross to the cafe. I know you don't like me holding your hand and i know you are not a child but i need to keep you safe, WHOA!! Phew that was close, you didn't see that car? That why i need to hold onto you, so sorry didn't mean to shout, just frightened for you, come on let's get something to eat.

What's the matter? You look petrified? Shhh , here, hold my hand and close your eyes for just 5 seconds, 1 2 3 4 5 now open them again, see? there are no snakes or serpents coming out of the carpet, it's just the pattern and your dementia playing up again. Why are you stepping over things that aren't there? oh, i see, its the blue in the carpet, what? it looks like puddles of water? yes, I can see what you mean,

What would you like? What do i think you want? How would i know? You want egg chips and beans, that's wonderful, would you like to order when the waiteress comes? Here she is.



No, he hasn't had a drink and hasn't got a speech impediment thank you, waitress!! He has dementia and mixes his words up sometimes, please don't worry it's not your fault, you don't know what you don't know I will drop some leaflets off. That was quick, here's your lunch, yes that's your knife on the right and fork on the left, don't worry about it. OOOPS missed your mouth? i do that so many times and please don't worry about the spillage, it will wash. No, i am sure the next table isn't looking at you and if they are then they are only curious and uneducated about those of us with dementia. Be careful that tea is hot, should have really got you a cold drink, .





I can see you yawning, are you tired? I know you feel you shouldn't be but it’s what happens, so much going on is bound to take it out of you. Here we go, back in the car now, sorry? You don't know where you are?? That’s ok, you're in your local town centre and we have just had lunch, Yes we really have and you enjoyed it LOL. Yes, i will take you home now, what do you mean you don't live here? You do my friend, come on in and sit down. Please don't cry it's been such a good day really, believe me, it could have been a lot worse, I know your frightened and frustrated and don't ever think you are on your own, there are millions of us s around the world just like us. Sundowning is horrible, we must try and explain to all what it’s like, its happens most afternoons so I must ask your loved ones/carer to change all your appointments to “AM “so it's easier for you, you are the most important person in all this, and the best thing is try and have a nap for an hour,



Goodbye my friend, Till next time

I can barely walk now.  I’m very dysfunctional. I came out with problems with my frontal and temporal lobes 15 years ago. I got by very well for 10 years but it caught up with me. Nobody talked to me about it. I don’t see the point in getting diagnosed. I might do it for my family.they don’t admit to what’s wrong with me. I’ve lost all my friends and family. All my interests. I can’t cry or laugh. My emotions are gone. It’s sad. Should I get diagnosed.they will take my car but I can’t really drive anyway. just the idea of  it being confirmed bothers me. Although I’m certain I have it. I don’t know why this happened to me. Bad genes.many of your loved ones are doing better than me.

Dementia after detention,AnonA,2021-12-26T20:59:47+0000,0,"The playlist that ideally represents what has happened with remains of my mind in this feral year:
bit.ly/3psV2P8
If there is any kind psychiatrist then there can be statement. I at first cared for combination like:
Amantadine (suspiction of syndrome simillar to neuroleptic maligniant syndrome)
Racetams (confirmed in research changes in OUN in the form of F03.1 Nearly Unspecified dementia or it can be F06.7 mild cognitive impairment, what nootropics besides glutation you recommend)
Selegiline (in association, for confirmed by medic from Styrska 44 systemic, severe, atypical, endogenous, drug-resistant MDD depression, with psychotic disorders in full remission)
I have taken also many others.  I have rather not any social anxiety but fobia also to psychiatrists. Normally sociable (and I have friends from Narodowa Antypsychiatria), only through Complete cognitive nihilism with afantasia (I sent actually a cover letter for experise under professor, it  includes afantasia, abulia, avolition and pale affect), I have not much to say.
Against it is sth simillar to oligophrenia (i am not any savant, in addition specific ortographia disorders F81.1 and agraphy), lack of fixations and movement stereotypies, derealisation disorders, certain schizoidity from grandpa of rather in family. I have post-stress disorders, maybe and Cotard syndrome, who knows but I am terrified of servs like of fire. I have identified cyst of pineal gland and other demienilisation disorders. For all that psycholrptics T50.905A drug intolerance better fit, besides that at beginning I had dementia. How the hay it couldn't be noticed!? I sleep whole day, nonstop walked sad, lack of interests, treated in the past with fluoxetine. Noone noticed it, who had ever had given them diplome from medicine!? Decreasing already low dopamine is like giving steroids to anorectic. In such case can be given e. g. ropinirol, pramipexol, pergolin, duloxetine, barbiturans, anxiolitics, even hydroxyzine could  be enough, but no Eli Lily pay and require olanzapines, dopamine dysinhibitors and other trash.  Afterwards there is haematoma of mesencephalon and a first warning sign is hesitation of pressure and excessive drowniness. There is also sth like melitracen+flupentixol. I had palpitations of heart, tachykardia, suffications, migraines, hipothermy, seizures (l-dopa helped for d1-like receptors) and suppressed suicidal tendencies WITHOUT realisation (because there are no thoughts, imagination, nothing!, recently beside black dot on white background after huperzine+b4). I have behaved like idiot sprayed denaturate because I was scared of this stupid, alleged virus. Never trust media cuz they are worse than patostreamers. Ten years I weren't in ""Azkaban"", modern internation place, subjected to detention.  I feel like trash, but it needed to be as tough as Chuck Norris. Of course, I don't do it nowadays.  I sued them but I can't win the case even with help of professor of law. Althrough psychopharmacy is dictatoress of sciences above mathematics. How to appoint procurers for goodness sake. O don't know if not this I would land in desired arrest for my bad relation (i am lil naughty, not twisted) IDK... I doubt... I regret that there is no on the market proxibarbal, fabomotisol, prazepam, trimetozine, tofisopame, mebicar, pemoline.   I have visit at 14.1 at known by me doctor. For now I ordered on yottaboost noopept as stronger derrivate of racetam.

Always remember, the life you have lived,

I have the cure for dementia,  alzimers and parkinsons. Several years ago I was diagnosed with brain tumours, after several surgical operations I am recovering well however as a direct result of the surgery I was left with little short term memory. The way it effected my day to day life was unbearable. I could not continue with the memory loss. I researched for a period of time to discover the medicinal properties of coconut oil. I used the oil myself (purchased from Holland and Barrett or ebay) and have managed to recover 70% of my memory. This is not just a theory I have used this very technique myself. From further research I have discovered it significantly improves the condition of anyone suffering from dementia, parkinsons and alzimers. All you need to do is take 3 teaspoons twice a day and watch the miracle occur. 

Kind regards

There’s a ‘rethink dementia’ page up on Facebook that anyone is welcome to join.

Memory cafes? time for a rethink ?,Norrms,2021-09-12T10:23:31+0100,0,"Hiya all, its with such relief we are opening our memory café up again after a very long 18 months of closure due to Covid, but the time closed has made me think. It’s a well-known fact that we opened ours all those years ago because we were disillusioned how another dementia charity was operating theirs by only allowing those with a diagnosis to attend. We thought this intolerable as it didn’t include those who just had cognitive problems or who were simply worried about getting the disease. I like to think over the years we have been proved right as we do “Allegedly “ run one of the most successful memory cafes in South Devon because of our approach of “ ALL ARE WELCOMED”



The reason we do this are many, but the main one is that our Motto is..



“Inclusion and Engagement for All “



And by this, we mean not only those who have dementia, but also those who have a loved one with it/ family member/ friend or even those who are worried about it which I know includes many people, but my point is if we dont open our doors to all, share our literature, give advice and help those who are worried about it, and let’s be honest who isn’t, then who does? As a predominantly dementia charity is it not our duty?, to help all with whatever connection to it, even if it's only inquiries? Of course, it is! It is also our duty to help all those who are lonely and feel isolated as well ?> as even though I know of no scientific research that says so for definite, it is highly regarded that loneliness can bring on dementia.



So I believe we are ALL responsible for looking after all those who have spent many years looking after us in their time of need, even if it means them having a good old knees-up every Saturday afternoon at our memory café, dementia or not. Covid has shown us how many vulnerable people are out there and its now out time to act.



so my message to all memory cafes out there are YRES please keep the name memory café but please make sure they are open and welcome to all who need whatever help at whatever time, after all



""A MEMORY CAFE IS NOT THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE LOSING YOUR MEMORY

IT`S THERE TO HELP YOU REMEMBER THOSE MEMORIES YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN """
Fighting dementia?,Norrms,2021-09-26T11:24:00+0100,0,"Dementia, Help us, to help you, to help us.



I am sorry if the title seems confusing but I promise it all will become clear. We have come so far in the last few years regarding dementia, fighting the good fight and so much good is being done by so many, so much so, that if it wasn’t, I truly believe this country would come to a complete standstill if it wasn’t for carers, nurses, care home`s etc, and as a person living with dementia I will always be eternally grateful for that. But when we talk about fighting dementia? What do we mean? What do we REALLY Mean? I will explain…….



May I ask all who read this, To get a true idea of what it’s like to fight dementia, how many of you have actually sat down with someone who has this awful disease, looked them in the eye, and asked

 “How do you fight this godforsaken illness? (Please remember not all of us are in late stages, we are human, we want to talk about it, please don't be afraid of upsetting us as we have answered far more personal questions during diagnosis that's a promise!! but please don't ask those in denial as that would be so upsetting for them)



I will let that sink in for a minute as I am a firm believer that if you don’t ask how we fight this, if you don’t sit down and talk to us and ask questions about how we try and cope and how we feel about the future, what happens after we have had hallucinations and a hundred more questions, where applicable, how are you ever going to know how to REALLY fight this disease with us?? My time will come, as sure as the sun sets, if they don’t find a cure for dementia, that I will be unable to write things like this to try and help and I hope that 10 years of blogging and recording You tube training videos will help you all  in the future to understand at least some of the things we go through, but unless you start to talk to us, how are we going to get you to understand how we feel and how then you can do something to help us, hence…..







“Help us, to help you, so you can help us



Because it’s a great help and so reassuring to us when people actually talk to us and ask us about our disease IE what type (The most important question in my humble opinion) Then we can tell you to try and make you understand so you can help us at a later date hopefully. Ask us about our loneliness even though we have friends and a loving family around us, ask us HOW we can get up after a night of hallucinations and even though we have flashbacks we try and carry on best we can until we start to sundown again, and please ask up about our hopes for the future and what WE would like to see change in the world re dementia.



If I am lucky enough to be asked how I cope? I always reply…..



When I get up in the morning I put my boots on and not my slippers!!!!



Oh if it was really as simple as that, I wish, but I hope you get the idea and we can start to fight dementia head on knowing that what you are doing you have got straight from the horse’s mouth. People with dementia don’t want to hear about Plaques and tangles etc, there is a place and time for that, but what we want to hear is how you’re going to help us in the future, because believe me, if the roles were reversed I would help you in a heartbeat"

Please dont take the Slide,Norrms,2021-03-23T10:07:02+0000,0,"Dementia and the Slide



If you are about my age, 60+ you may well remember the slides in the playgrounds of our youth were about  20 feet + high, for anybody aged 45 and under, I believe that’s about 6 and a half metres. We had no such thing as health and safety in those days but what we did have was good old common sense, remember that??  Much missed these days. Its only when you get older and start to reminisce you start to compare it to other things, for instance?


Dementia and the Slide



The steps up to the top of the slide were many and multiple, a bit like the years of your life, quick to run up at first then a bit slower and out of breath when you reach the top, but once there you looked around you felt like the king of the world!!  You could breathe;you could see things clearer and also, almost see the future right in front of you.  This is similar to when you’re at the top of your game, both in work and in family life and all is well with the world, but then as you step onto the slide you notice something’s not quite right and you start to have doubts, IE the beginning of Dementia.  


All you had known and done suddenly doesn’t seemas certain anymore and the confidence you were full of not long ago is starting  to ebb away, you hesitate and look down, my goodness it seems a long way down,its starts to cloud over and go dull, and yet you know you want to slide down this wonderful slide of life as you have many times before, but you’re scared,for the first time in a long time you feel scared (this is when it dawns on you that you have this awful disease)

As you sit and stretch out your now shaking legs on the slide you hold onto the Bars at the top for dear life as you can feel someone behind pushing you downwards and shouting LET GO it will be ok, but you know, deep down,  it won’t and you know by now that’s the voice of dementia trying to drag you into the abyss. Then suddenly, as with dementia you start to slip and slide down the slide but stuttering and stopping as you go as if you are going through the different stages of dementia, your hand`s scratch at the sides and your finger`s hurt as you try to stop yourself from  slipping farther and farther down into dementias evil den, your shoes are flat down on the surface doing everything you can to slow your descent, you have never worked as hard in your life as you’re doing now, trying to stop this awful downwards ride. You scream in  fright as the end gets closer and closer, and then, just near the end you start to speed up as you realise all is lost and you have come to terms with what’s about to happen, only hoping that all who know and who have travelled down this slide with you during happier times,  remember the boy who took his very first step on the ladder of 


THE SLIDE OF LIFE


I hope you Never take the slide when your older and try to remember all the good times when you were younger.

Message to the youth of today,Norrms,2021-07-20T09:33:15+0100,0,"Yesterday's zoom meeting...

Yesterday's zoom meeting with about 25 teenagers who want to work in care went really well. It was a boisterous beginning as they are teenagers, after all, lol but soon settled down and within minutes you could have heard a pin drop

The great thing about this meeting was they had each all prepared a question to ask at the end, which was so thoughtful and doesn't usually happen, The questions were great but the one that sticks with me is when one asked how they could all help us with dementia ? my answer went like this.....

I said.....

"""" You are the youth of today and the leaders of tomorrow, if you all take away what I have said today and share it, it will reduce the stigma surrounding this disease of dementia until eventually there will be none, you can teach all around, your families and eventually your own children so they will take it forever forward, please do this, that's all we ask..

Why The Care has to be Consistent,Norrms,2021-06-28T10:13:43+0100,0,"WHY THE CARE HAS TO BE CONSISTENT
When you caring for somebody with dementia-like me, or caring for anybody else who needs it, getting the right type of care is so important, and when it comes to someone with dementia, even more so in my humble opinion. People have often asked me if I could go back ten years, is there anything I would change? I always say YES! I would tell myself not to be so selfish and stubborn and accept the care offered at the time. Looking back now I can see how tired my wife was and how stressed she would get without getting any kind of break.
If you work as a paid carer, you can hand over or clock off at the end of the day, but when you’re looking after someone at home like a loved one, you certainly can’t, it’s a 24/7 job and a very hard one at that, so you have to make sure you get a break yourselves, after all, if we don’t look after the carers? Who will look after the cared for? So often I have been told that when carers get a break for six or seven hours it feels like a weekend away, it means so much.
The most important thing is to try and “suit” the carer with the person who needs care and this can be done in a few ways. You are fully within your rights to ask the “would-be” carer to come and have a coffee with you and meet your loved one who needs care. The care companies all need your hard-earned money and no matter how long it takes, it’s so important to get this right. Also getting someone about the same age is pivotal as usually, they will have the same interests. Also, some men only want male company and the same for ladies. A shared interest is always a great thing, for me and my carer it's fishing, but for some, it may be football, or bowling, Bingo, or dominoes, it really doesn’t matter but far better to chat away about things you like than things you don’t.
The one thing that anybody being looked after will tell you, which is the most important, is consistency. Please know you can ask and insist for the same carer every time they visit and if the care company won’t do that? Then look for one that will, they do exist, I have had the same carer for 5 years now, bless him, it really is that simple, you are paying them to provide a service. If you paid for a settee on HP and they sent you an oven you wouldn’t pay for that would you?? A bit extreme I know but you can see what I mean. The thing is, to see the same friendly face on a regular basis is so important to the person being cared for, they become friends and a relationship of trust and friendship is built. As you know, I am no novice to this, and I know some companies change staff like we all change our socks, but there are a lot of incredible wonderful carers out there who have worked for the same company for years. They will have the know-how, they will have the experience and they will know what to do in an emergency situation if that ever arises.
So please choose carefully because you yourself also need to know and have the peace of mind that your loved one is being looked after as well

I'm hoping someone might have some good advice about a problem with clocks/time - my dad has been given a really nice calendar clock (a Memrabel 2 - awful name!) by the local memory service that he's taken against as being an ""old person's clock"" which he resents! The trouble is that lately he just doesn't believe the time it displays, so he ends up calling and texting people in the early hours of the morning. When I get him to verify what the clock says by checking it against his watch he says it's a conspiracy, and his latest 2am text to me claimed that lockdown was doing strange things to clocks! I'm at a loss as to what to do to help him believe it when his calendar clock says e.g. ""Thursdy morning 3AM"". He lives on his own so there isn't anyone on-hand to put him right.

Swimming is my lifeline and the only sport I can still participate in.  However, due top my declining spatial awareness (and in consideration of other swimmers) I am safest and  best left to swim alongside the edge of the pool.  Today I was prevented from doing this despite what I thought was a rational explanation to two swimmers determined not to allow this.  Unusually for me I am extremely upset about this and unsure how to cope.  I don't want sympathy, I just need tgo know how anyone else may cope with such situations.

Diagnosis of dementia and change of treatment by a new doctor,Fyne72,2021-02-13T23:27:19+0000,0,I have been treated for Altzimers for the past 4 years by my senior neurologist with 10mg of Aricept and Clonotril 0.5mg plus Mirapexin 0.18mg.Last month after tests she gave me Memantine Accord10mg morning and 10mg nightime . Now a GP changed my regime  and stopped Aricept  saying he did not think that I should be taking it along with Memantine.  This G P does not know me.  Can he do this.
When is a carer not a carer?,Norrms,2021-01-30T09:52:50+0000,0,"Q? When is a Carer not a Carer? Ans ? Apparently and according to those who say what order the vaccinations go, when its an unpaid carer!! I kid you not.

Yesterday i found out the very disturbing news that all ""Unpaid carers"" do not qualify for vaccination the same time as other paid carers in full-time work ?? Now don't get me wrong, the carers that work in care homes, and visit people at home should be and quite rightly are at the top of the pile when it comes to vaccinations, but what about the ""Forgotten Army"" of carers in the UK who are unpaid and look after those most vulnerable in our society ?? You know, those that cannot clock off, or go for a break, or ask someone to take over, the ones who don't go home at the end of the day but are there 24/7 looking after loved ones, you know, the ones who didn't ask to be a carer?? What about all of those when it comes to vaccinations??

Do you most of these so-called unpaid carers get Carer's allowance so is that not some kind of payment for what they do? So what's the difference ?? Everything about this is wrong, both  morally and logically. ""Worst case scenario"" unpaid carers become sick and possibly die with covid because they have to shop etc for loved ones who are most vulnerable to this awful disease. Who then looks after those left behind ?? The paid carers ? My God have they not enough to do at the moment?


Am i being biased? B****Y right i am, i have dementia and  if it wasn't for my incredible wife Elaine who has nursed me through the last few years and looked after me the way she has i would be DEAD!! It really is as simple as that !! Can you even begin to imagine how guilty we feel because we will get our vaccinations before our loved ones who are caring for us, the worry that goes with it, waiting for them to get theirs ??
My friends, there is something very wrong here and i will not let this rest until i have been given a sensible answer or something changes very quickly

This Time dementia ? you got t oh so wrong,Norrms,2020-09-16T09:28:28+0100,0,"THIS TIME DEMENTIA? YOU GOT IT OH SO WRONG !!



As I sat there in my chair mid-afternoon I had an incredible smell of soap powder (Washing powder they call it today ) filtering up my nostrils. I always joke with Elaine that I love Comfort on my clothing and can tell which is which by smelling my shirts but this was different, it was a very strong smell and one I recognised straight away and yet it was impossible???



I turned to see if Elaine was doing the washing but she was writing something down at the table and no washing machine was on (For a change LOL) Then I just sat back, sniffed once again, sat back, closed my eyes and I was transported back to my home town of Bolton, lancs UK, just off Seymour road actually and I was stood, once again outside of the ACDO washing powder factory. The smell was unmistakable and very comforting in a funny kind of way, because it was a part of my youth I remember so well. I used to deliver evening papers all around that area as a boy and have very happy memories of it, up and down Seymour road also doing the streets adjoining, running across Crompton way to Watermillock House (Now a Toby Inn) then back over through the streets by St Paul’s church and back to the shop on Blackburn road.



For just a few moments I was a boy again, for just a few moments I was so very happy, fit and nothing in the world to worry about. You see, now I have dementia, the Lewy body type, and have written about the awful things I see and hear which nobody else can, as well as the things I smell, but DEMENTIA?? BOY did you get it wrong this time I am happy to say, because the smell took me back to a place of safety, and a time when nothing could hurt me. I will never thank you for this Dementia as you have hurt me too many times, but I will smile for a very long time because you got it SO WRONG this time

I am here, yet i am not,
I have been somewhere, yet only part of me has come back,
Frustration runs through my blood , where calmness used to be,
People say you are doing very well, so kind and appreciated, and yet, deep inside i weep, knowing my time is limited
On the outside, showing the world the smile,
Yet on the inside, raging and curled with fear of whats to come,
Dreading the late afternoon when confusion reigns,
Deeply fearing each and every night when the demons come to visit with relentless repetitiveness
Seeing things that you cannot see, or i would ever want you to see, or any other human being for that matter, the screams, the horrific visions that play out in front of my very eyes even though my eyes are sometimes closed
Wondering, worrying how long one persons brain can take such torment until they break completly.
Knowing one day i will go away and never come back, trapped in dementia`s  tormentous world.
Sometimes People only see what they want to see, i see many things i dont want to see,
On good days i sit here and write, mornings are my best time, yet on others i despair, head in hands not understanding what is going on around me
It comes at me in waves but with no warning, slamming into me until all around me is misty and foggy, seeing only grotesque shapes all around me,
Yet i am still here?
Yet i am still me?
I dont feel like me sometimes, i question all i say and do, my days are filled with uncertainty and dread
Yet here i am, apparently?
i am still here, i am still fighting

The Does and the Don’ts,NotTooLate,2020-04-26T12:14:23+0100,0,"As I’ve read post, it became clear that there is a divide often between those that want to know the diagnosis and those that don’t. 
It does seem to be divided by which position you are in. If you are the Carer, then you seem to want a diagnosis to verify what you’ve been saying all along and then there is the one that is showing the signs, that really do not want to be told! 

I would ask, what is the benefit of knowing? I’m not sure if this means you can claim benefits that will help in the care, but other than that, there does seem very little to be gained. I am talking from the position of have been told I have dementia, so as you may expect, my view is slightly biased.

It is also clear to me that both those looking after and those being looked after, know that there is a problem and what the problems are related to. Often it seems the moment those problems first start to manifest themselves are also quite marked. 

Having just read this post, ‘Spotting the early signs of dementia: What’s the point.’ I’m still at a loss to know why anyone would want to know, unless there is something that can be done to change the course of it!?

It does state that recently a number of trials testing new treatments for dementia have failed, but they believe it might be because they are looking a people in which the condition has gone too far!?

Firstly, billions have been put into research to find a treatment and none have proven any benefit as a cure! Secondly, why does the system still insist on delaying any testing and assessments for people that first raise concerns. It seems to be that by the time a diagnosis is given, for many, the prognosis is 99% an end game!?

The research states that changes in the brain associated with dementia my begin up to fifteen years before the symptoms begin. Apparently if they could detect these people, they could start testing more treatments. 

My questions: 

Where has this 15 year figure come from, because if you do a bit of research yourself, this figure changes? 

What treatments are they talking about, the same treatments they are using now, in the hope that using them earlier will solve the problem?

What are the treatments for and what is the hope?

They talk of looking for triggers that lead to dementia developing, but this is not an original idea. This has been a question since dementia research begun! 

Where is the research into the history of people with dementia, what happened before the signs, looking at medical records and accounts that may seem to have no direct connection, such as bereavement and depression?

They talk of novel ways to diagnose dementia, but they don’t say what they are looking for?

Simple blood test to detect what?

AI to understand the impact of tau and amyloid plaques affect nerve cells. An area that has still no proven causal link to dementia.

VR to help assess memory and behavioural problems. Should try asking the people involved, the demented and the carers!?

GameChanger and using smartphones to look at an idea called healthy ageing. I though ageing didn’t play a part, or am I reading the wrong research papers?

The biggest resource that is used the least…. the carers and the cared for! When will these people be seen as the solution to the problems, rather than just the problem, the lab rats and research as just something to complete a degree, master, or doctorate?

It is surely obvious to most by now, that dementia is not something we catch! There is a cause, it starts early for most. 

If research stays with the same dogmatic framework, progress will continue to be slow, or as so far, none existent! Millions and Billions wasted!  In the meantime, millions around the world are given little or no hope and for those that are oblivious, they are hoping  to be bringing you the bad news soon!  

You may be asking why am I so worried about this and the answer is simple, I'm one of those sent home to die, without hope, in an uncertain manner, lost, alone and scared! While people play with their games and blood test. If you was me, what would you do?"

coming to terms with Dementia,Rushdenboy,2020-11-17T16:26:07+0000,0,I got my Diagnosis on the 2 November this year so not quite 2 weeks ago finding it hard to to come to terms with the fact that i have got it
Self Diagnosis,WJG,2020-09-17T11:52:49+0100,0,"For some time I've believed that difficulties I'm facing (apathy, lack of empathy, loss of humour, emotional flat-effect) are due to some form of neurological issue. This view was dismissed by psychiatrists in another part of the country ,  as I was told that if I had dementia I would by definition not score well on cognitive tests. So no further tests were done.

I have now moved, and as a result of renewed discussion with a different Mental Health Team have had a CT scan. As I detail in another post, this has led to me being forwards for a SPECT  scan. I continue to sail through cognitive tests, although I feel that I am struggling a bit more with some intellectual tasks than I once did.

I now have in writing the results of the CT scan from the Consultant Radiologist: 'Opinion: Moderate generalised frontal predominant cortical atrophy'

I am being urged not to jump to the conclusion that this (together with my symptoms)means I have early frontotemporal dementia. But anything I read online - only from reputable sources - suggests to me that this is probably the case.  Which scares me, to be frank. 

Am I catastrophising, or just putting 2 and 2 together to make 4?"
Neurogenesis - a bit of Hope!?,NotTooLate,2020-05-04T15:17:25+0100,0,"In 1928 a professor Ramon Cajal claimed that in the brain the nerve paths are something fixed, ended, immutable. Everything may die, nothing may be regenerated. He believed that where all other cells in the body regenerate, the brain cells, were unique in the fact that they did not renew!

This has been followed and believed ever since, that is until recently and now research has proven that brain cells do regenerate and this is called, Neurogenesis.

What the researchers discovered was that within each of our brains there exists a population of neural stem cells which are continually replenished and can differentiate into brain neurones. Simply stated, we are all experiencing brain stem cell therapy every moment of our lives.

As you might expect, the process of neurogenesis is controlled by our DNA. A key role in creating new neurones is a specific gene which appears to control the production of a particular protein. This protein is given the amazing title of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Studies reveal that there is decreased BDNF in Alzheimer’s patients, as well as in a variety of neurological conditions including epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

So, this sounds interesting and hopeful, but it gets better. Many of the factors that influence the DNA code/trigger to produce BDNF are affected by our chosen life style. Most are already well known, diet, health and fitness.

Some Myths and Truths 

Truth: The brain keeps growing new brain cells your entire life. This process of neurogenesis is how the brain upgrades itself and enhances your quality of life.

Myth: Your brain stops growing in your early twenties. After that you only lose brain cells.

Myth: Ageing means cognitive decline and memory loss; after middle age life is just one gradual downhill slide into decrepitude. 

Truth: There is great variation in people’s rate of neurogenesis.

Truth: Your rate of neurogenesis is tied to the quality of your life.

Truth: You can increase your rate of neurogenesis by three to five times at all ages, young, middle aged and old. You can operate at a higher level of brain function in your twenties and thirties, in middle age as well your sixties, seventies and beyond.

Myth: Your genes determine how you age and how long your brain stays sharp.

Myth: You reach your mental peak in your twenties and thirties. Nothing can be done to make you sharper once you’re middle aged or beyond.

Myth: Depression is a biological illness caused by low serotonin levels. It requires lifelong SSRI drugs to treat it.

Truth: You can operate at a higher level than ever before believed possible. At any age you can be smarter,, remember more, be more vibrant, alive, free of depression, and resistant to stress. When you increase your rate of neurogenesis, the potential of your brain is unknown, but the potential is increased! 

To be able to increase Neurogenesis is to improve your entire life, how you think, feel, function and act. I believe that more than this, it may help to slow, stop, or even reverse the signs and symptoms of dementia.

"I might have frontotemporal dementia, but I might have something else",WJG,2020-09-15T12:16:32+0100,0,"I'm in the unusual position of seemingly being the only person who thinks I have frontotemporal dementia - whereas other people seem (at this stage) to think I have depression, or other psychiatric difficulties. So I'm keen to try and work out what the real problem is.

I know that people with FTD are generally unaware of their difficulties, whereas I know that my personality has changed. I have gone from being a lively extrovert person to someone who wants to hide from the world, who suffers a lot from apathy and who seems to have lost both my sense of empathy and my sense of humour.

I have had a CT scan that shows 'a degree of atrophy' to my frontal lobes. I have had cognitive tests that show no detriment. I am on a waiting list for a SPECT scan (tests have been arranged by a consultant psychiatrist).

For my part, I'm not sure how I can adequately explain why I think I have bvFTD other than by saying I don't feel I have any control over my feelings of Anhedonia etc.. And I'm convinced that talking therapies such as CBD would now mean nothing to me. I also have a sense of things slowly but steadily getting worse.

But people point out that:1. I am aware of changes to me 2. I don't have obsessive behaviours 3. I don't have problems with behaviours that transcend social norms 4.I show no signs at all of cognitive impairment. So, it is suggested, the problem is probably one of Depression and/or other psychiatric difficulties. 

Can anyone suggest please what any useful next steps might be for me to try and sort out what's going on? Is there anywhere that I could refer myself to?"

Please feel free to read and comment....

I feel I am in a very complicated situation due to the recent split from my partner and wondered if it would be possible to meet someone, where I could possibly try to explain the best I can, or outline of how its come about, and if there is any possible help in somehow finding accommodation or I go about it.

I split from from my partner on Saturday 18th July. The main reason being that both myself and my partner feel we no longer love each other and see no point in staying together any longer. We have been together for over 30 yrs and have 3 grown up children. We divorced 20 odd years ago, but got back together shortly afterwards. We never remarried and had been happy enough because of it .. until now that is.

Although we have managed to stay together for this many years, it was mainly only because of our children.

Unfortunately, we let our eldest son stay with us recently because we were worried about his well being ( drugs and drink). At first..  he was a pleasure to have around and was being very helpful, as well as finding work for himself almost immediately. Unfortunately that all changed after a simple argument between him and me that simply spiralled out of control by his long term resentment towards me. I thought it could have been going over the top, but on reflection my outburst  of a few chosen words where nothing compared to the abusive outburst I recieved in reply. He is 31years old, very fit, strong and healthy and knows I am no longer able to chastise or challenge if you know what I mean.,. in other words I fear for my safety by staying there any longer. I have been recently diagnosed with PPA -Primary Progressive Aphasia ( 3 or 4 months ago ) - which to me as a layman, is a very rare form of Alzheimer’s . I have finally accepted that I have this disease after not really accepting until now, where the symptoms are slowly becoming more obvious to me.. Hopefully I will try to care for myself from now and listen more to the experts,.. whom I have not taken note from the offset..  I also suffer from epilepsy, but has been well controlled with the help of tablets.
My major problem now finding accommodation for myself.

We have just moved home from living in Devon for 20 yrs to Dorset only a few months ago, thinking life would be better in a new county to more or less enjoy our retirement together but I know that that is not going to be the case no longer.

I was born and bred in Normanton in West Yorkshire but as I say I have lived in the West Country for 30 years or so and what I now called home.  I have now had to return back to my roots for family support and to where I will be staying until I can find accommodation for myself and to start afresh. My sisters are in their 70s and I feel I am imposing by staying there. I have the best sisters in the world.. all five of them and I dont want to impose to long.

As I say..this is very complicated for me to explain and wondered if there is any help that would be availiable if or I could make a possible appointment to see a advisor to discuss my future.

I find it hard to answer simple questions because of my condition, (but I can) I simply find it easier to text, where I can sit and think more slowly and clearly before replying orally.

I can now hear the telly in the other room. You have most likely experience this for yourself. You are in the other room, but you can hear those soft, muted and muffled voices. You cannot quite make out what is being said, but your brain tells you it’s the telly, or the radio. Well that is what I hear, but it happens in every room I’m in! I cannot go into the room and turn the telly off, because it isn’t on!



What I’m doing now is turning the telly on and turning the sound up. This way I’m hearing the telly and as I go from one room to the other, the telly is still that constant. When I turn the telly off, the telly in the other room starts.



Ideas and suggestion please?

Question Time for Carers... Week 2...Only 1 Question?,NotTooLate,2020-04-20T15:14:19+0100,0,"Last week I got 15 amazing replies and this gave me a lot to think about! 

All were extremely well stated and informative. It was obvious that these were people with a lot of first hand knowledge regarding all things related to dementia.

What did disappoint, a bit, was that there were over 870 people that viewed this post!

This week I’m going to try again, but only with one question. 

This will be based on the main findings of last week’s questions. 

This Week’s Question:

Did you, or the person you cared for, or are caring for, have some significant event prior to the first signs, or symptoms of dementia being noticed?’ 

Yes, or No?

If you would like to add the information about the nature of the event, I would be grateful!

Fall
Blow to the head
Accident
loss of a loved one
Illness
Heart Attack
Mental illness
Drugs issue

Question Time for Carers... Week 3...Only 1 Question?,NotTooLate,2020-04-29T11:17:19+0100,0,"I’m continuing with the same theme of possible related events,  leading to later onset of dementia. We have looked at key events prior to the onset of dementia, now we will look a lot further back, maybe decades.

I’ve been reading about research into devising ways to determine if someone can be tested for dementia, before the signs, or symptoms show. This seems to be all on the premise that the possible causes of dementia may have started years and possibly decades before any symptoms were noted.

We have all heard of the well known footballers and boxers that have developed later dementia. It seems obvious that continually heading a ball, or being punched, will damage the brain. However, there is no definitive proof that this is true. The cause of the original injury has long gone and only the onset of dementia remains. Often there seems to be no related cause.

In my case, doing a bit of research into my medical records and drawing a history line of my health life, it seems that an insect bite, that caused a major allergic reaction, that impacted heavy on my immune system, does seem to be the start of all my problems and leading to this final diagnosis of dementia. Now at the time, I was given treatment, which I believe was antihistamines. I was in France when this happened. I never recovered fully, but I was able to get on with my life. Later a doctor suggested a Lyme disease test be carried out. No positive results. The doctor then explained, ‘It is like a hit-and-run accident. Whatever caused the damage has gone and only the damage remains!’

This change my viewpoint dramatically. I had always thought I would find the cause and then be able to treat it, but now I realise I can only live with the damage.

This week’s question:

Looking back as far as you can, try to trace the significant things that happened ie, did they do anything that may have caused brain injury, such as sports, did they have any major illness, measles etc, any accident, fall or car crash, etc.

We all had knocks, bumps, coughs and colds, but it is that thing that had a major impact on that person's life, that I'm looking for and only you can evaluate that?

Question: If the person with dementia, had any significant event many years ago, please, briefly state the event and how many years before the person was diagnosed?  

Examples:    Car accident that caused head injury.  22 years 
                          Lyme disease.   31 years

If there is no significant event throughout their life, just start, None

Many thanks for taking part!

Question Time for Carers,NotTooLate,2020-04-13T15:35:49+0100,0,"I’ve been trying to find other fellow sufferers of dementia, to share our experiences in hope that together we can do something positive about it.

However, I’m not having much success, yet, but I will keep trying. So, while I continue on this task, I realised that there is another avenue to explore in regard to all things dementia related and that is of course Carers.

Carers’ have a unique and extensive knowledge, based on first hand experience. I’m hoping you will help me by sharing that knowledge and expertise. On this forum alone, there are over 64 thousand registered members and together with my own findings, evidence suggest that the majority of those registered are Carers. This means that a far greater pool of knowledge exist here,  than any I would hope to find related directly to people sufferering first hand with dementia.

This is how I would like you to help;

Each week I will produce a small set of questions. I wish to keep the number of questions low, so I can focus on a theme for the questions and avoid the drudgery of that tedious batch of questions that jump from one theme to another. Hopefully by doing it this way, you are more likely to be willing to contribute. I’m hoping that, because it will only require a  very short amount of your time to respond, a large group will be happy and keen to get involved and the higher the response the greater the related outcome.

I will require no names, or any personal information. The answers given will be based solely on trust. I don’t see that anyone in the roll of a Carer, or patient, would want to falsify answers. I was told that to give any value to the information I gained, I would need to verify the source of that information. This is true if I was taking an academic path, but I’m not. This is purely for the benefit of sharing collated information to those that could hopefully benefit from it ie, those that have a direct, or indirect connection with  some form of dementia, now and in the even those to come in the future. I think it is important to accept your sincerity and give value to the answers you give and think they deserve.

As the answers to the questions arrive, I will collate  the findings and keep you informed of the progress and outcome. I want people to be aware of the results and maybe make conclusions based on those findings, plus raise concerns, ideas and suggestions, that will lead to further questions that can be set here at a future date. In this way I see the information and findings developing as we progress, rather that setting out to answer a singualr question.

I hope that you will to accept my explanation and will happily take part. I’m excited to see how the response and method develops. If you have any ideas, suggestions, possible questions, then I would be truly grateful to receive them?

Please note: It is obvious that the response of a Carer, may be different to that of anyone with dementia, so I would ask that I start each week’s questions by asking you to say if you are a Carer, or have dementia.

The questions relate to the person being cared for, or the person with dementia.

Please try and keep your anwsers concise as possible.

Below are this week’s questions.

Are you, or have you been a Carer, or do you have Dementia?

1.  What is the name of the Dementia?

2.  What was the first signs, or symptoms you noticed?

3.  How many years ago did you first notice these signs, or symptoms?"
"Is it the Effect, or Affect?",NotTooLate,2020-04-26T06:52:22+0100,0,"I use Pages on Mac to write everything. Pages is just a text editor, a souped-up typewriter. It can help with how things look and the layout, just to make sure it looks nice, but more, it helps me to keep check of my spelling and my grammar. This is vital and a big, big help for me today. However, I do still get things wrong, but I have friends who do the proofreading and  double check that what I write, makes sense. Believe me, what I write often does not make sense, even to me when I read it back, but that is why I redraft over and over.

I’ve started to read and record myself. This seems to help with my writing. As I read the words on the screen I will become aware that it doesn’t flow, it doesn’t make sense, there are too many words, or words are missing. If you have a similar problem, then this may be something you could try.

Now, what I’m getting back again and again, are two words that I’m getting mixed up all the time. The words are, Effect and Affect! I thought  I knew the difference, but realised that when I’m writing, I get a block with these words. I’m sure that like me you have those moments too? You are writing away and then you stop and for a second think?… How do I spell that?…. and maybe you look into space for the Divine intervention! Well I don’t know the difference between the two words. I did, but I’ve forgotten it. So, I am going to try and relearn this. I want to know if this is possible, or is it too late and I’ve gone passed a point of return?

I’m going to try this over the next few days and see how it goes with my future writing and, if I remember, I will tell you how I get on. You will of course have to take my word on it!

It these two words cause you a bit of a problem too, then you could start by checking this out….

Doesn't Do it Anymore!,NotTooLate,2020-04-25T17:20:41+0100,0,"I used to enjoy a nice cup of coffee. It always gave me that little lift, but now, nothing! I can drink coffee at bedtime and drop off without any problem at all.


What is going on? Does coffee stimulate a particular part of the brain and is that particular part of my brain, now being effected by whatever is causing my dementia?


I suppose it could just be a case of becoming used to it. Coffee is a stimulant and like all stimulants, we can become accustomed to the dose. The brain becomes used to it and the amount of coffee we take becomes normalised. We can mentally and physically feel this loss and then start to craze for a cup of coffee. We then require more and more, to have the same impact!?


It could be I’ve gone off coffee!

Just too many people!,NotTooLate,2020-04-25T17:17:38+0100,0,"A strange thing that I live with and affects my life daily, is the number of people around me. I cannot cope with too many people, I just start to panic out of control!

The first time I can recall this happening was in a supermarket. I had joined a queue and the queue continued to develop behind me. The sensation of being closed in started to overtake me. A wave of panic washed through me, like a physical thing. I can remember staring at the floor, trying to blot this crazy feeling out of me. I did know that it was irrational, but my body didn’t seem to agree and I was losing control. The more I tried to put it aside, the worse it got. The effort of trying to shut it out was having the opposite effect. I was getting swept away by this cycle of fear.

As I sat in the car, feeling such an idiot, trying to explain to myself why I had rushed out of the shop leaving everything.
This has been a continual problem and is, I think, similar to being claustrophobic, something I also seem to suffer from now and something I’ve never had a problem with. It feels as if I’m being closed in by people, trapped. This does sound completely ridiculous and now, sitting here writing this, I have to agree, but as I’m thinking about more people around, I’m starting to feel that panic welling up in the pit of my stomach.

Usually this is only a problem when they are close, but last Thursday it seemed to be developing into something more. I put my, NHS flag out and waited for eight o’clock. I started to open the back gate and saw people in the street, just waiting to I assumed, but I could feel this thing. It made it impossible for me to go out. Quickly closing the gate, I returned to the back garden and loudly rang my bell. It was as if I was trying to drown out the panic, the racing heart, the pounding head.

This only seemed to really go when I was finally back inside and everywhere was locked and I felt secure.

I know this is happening and the mere thought of situations that mean I will be with others, like appointments, or shopping etc, makes me start to panic. As set times get closer, the intensity of problems start to become more extreme. It is better for me to just not get in this situation. Being with one or two that I know can help. I seem to be able to focus on them, but it is when that focus is interrupted that the problems start.

I’ve been mainly on my own now for a long time and seem to be able to cope well, with no real problems with a few, but when more people close in, I find it terrifying! The problem with this is my reaction. I loose control and snap, becoming violent and verbally aggressive. This is another part of my changing personality, that I don’t think is me. It is certainly something that I detest, so do everything I can to avoid this situation ever happening.

I’m not sure if this is getting worse, but I am at a loss of how to beat it!

How Do I Write!?,NotTooLate,2020-04-15T16:40:18+0100,0,"I recieved an email, not too long ago and I was asked how I manage to write and why sometimes I don’t seem to reply straight away?

My first comment was, why do you think I cannot write? but it is obvious, we all know what he means; Dementia means you have lost it, gone, cuckoo and everything is impossible now! Well, it’s not true! Dementia does not mean the end of you, it just means we may have to do things a little bit different now, but I think that is the same for all of us as we get older!?

So, now to let you into my secret, I don’t reply directly. I have to copy your post and paste it into, Pages, the Mac text editor. I then start to compose an answer. This then requires redrafting a few times, until I’m happy that it is making sense.

I have a tendency to miss a lot of words. My brain obviously works faster than my hands. Spelling and grammar are the next things, but great, Pages has a built in checker for both. Depending on the length of the reply, or my blog post, because this is done in the same manner, except, I just start with ideas and thoughts written down, it takes me a morning, or afternoon session to complete, so that is about 2,3, or 4 hours. Then it is ready to post!

I find this method good for me and it isn’t new, I’ve always written in this way, it just a bit harder now  and needs a bit more attention and help to complete correctly!

The physical method of typing and the mental effort of going through this whole process is good for keeping my brain active, or that is what I believe. If you don’t use it you lose it! This applies to many things.

So, I apologise if I don’t reply straight away, but I am working on it!

I do have a tendency to go on a bit sometimes, but that is not new either!

Please comment anytime and don’t worry about offending me, I’m thick skinned!

I’m here for me and if along the way I can help anyone else, then that is a big bonus!

It’s Gabapentin Again!,NotTooLate,2020-04-14T13:36:44+0100,0,"This is my first completed week following the continued reduction of Gabapentin.

Morning 100mg Afternoon 100mg Night 200mg

Coming off Gabapentin is causing me major problems. I’ve been on this for so long, my body not only accepts this as normal, but is doing everything it can to maintain the full dose! This is addiction and I think it is the same for any type of addiction that people are trapped in. However, the withdrawals, I believe, are very much dependant on the drug that is the route of the addiction. Not all drugs are equal. I came off Morphine and I thought this would be the worst it could be, but I was so wrong! It is obvious to me now, that it depends on what the drug is doing and how it interacts with your body and how the individual is able to cope with this.


I’m studying Gabapentin and will write a piece about it soon.


I’m having lots of physical affects, such as a continual headache on the left side of my head. It’s not severe, but is a constant deep, dull ache. My temperature is up one minute and down the next, I’m either putting another top on or taking it off. My heart seems quite erratic and can race a bit too much. My GTN seems to help with this. I feel very distant. What I mean by this is everything seems to be going on around me, as though I’m observing from some other place. This very much seems to go along with, what I call, my absences. This is where I shift from being here, in the moment and not; like shifting between being in a dream and being awake. My neurologist said these are caused by mini seizures, petit mals.


One of the main problems is my ghost, my hallucinations, what I see, hear and feel. It seems that I’m more aware. I do think not having Finn here, doesn’t help. You see, when I would become aware of something, that feeling of something walking over your grave thing, I would automatically look for Finn, who was always just there and if he was unaware, I would find myself almost switching off. Finn would confirm that what I was experiencing was not real and, while I continued to see, hear, or feel these things, I could accept them. I know this sounds strange, but this was normal for me. Now, without Finn, I’m finding I don’t have that check and my anxiety is increasing as I seem to experience them more and more. It feels as if they are getting out of control.


The other big problem is my seizures. If I have a major, grand mal, seizure, once a month, then that was about normal. Sometimes I could go longer than this without any at all, but I cannot remember when I was suffering more than this, till now! Over the last week, I have had two!

I'm a Fax machine!?,NotTooLate,2020-04-06T11:51:04+0100,0,"I remember, not too long ago, or maybe it was, when I had a Fax machine. Well to be correct, it was an App.


Apps, this is one of those newish terms we use now without thinking about. I’m 65, so I grew up in the explosion of new technology and wanted to learn everything there was to learn, from programming and the computer programs that were being produced to do all these amazing things like… well I’ll leave that bit for you to decide, but these were called programs. Then someone, up there with the Gods, just below the big God, decided programming doesn’t really sound that good, more like brainwashing, sort of. It was decided that something nicer, friendly, applicable… ‘Application sounds nice,’ said, Geoffrey. ‘Oh No! said, Zippy, ‘Much too long!’ he responded in his usual intellectual and knowledgeable manner. Then Bungle piped up, using his two brain cells to fire a debate worthy of an Oxford debating society meeting. ‘Errr… App…. and before the full word could be expressed, the reply from, Geoffrey and Zippy, in unison, ‘App!’ ‘Perfect!’ Bungle, just look bemused and nodded! And all was good and everybody was happy again!


I know, I’m wondering again!


So, back to my Fax machine, or to be correct, my Fax App. I learned everything about it and I think I could do it all! The company had done a fantastic job of self promoting it. Why their program, sorry App, was not running the country, no the World, I just don’t know!? I now knew how to fax and had sent loads to myself. You can always tell a good app, because a good app lets you spend more time playing with yourself, than ever playing with anyone else. As everyone knows, this is possibly the main maxim of life… maybe?


Now, Days, weeks and months went by and my fax app gathered dust. Well it didn’t because it’s a program inside the computer, but metaphorically speaking, it was gathering dust. Does that make sense? Finally, I set the little fax icon on the screen free and deleted the app. I ended up creating a Folder called, Fax… added the program, sorry again, App, then burned it to a disc! Now there is something else I could rabbit on about, burning and discs… maybe I should explain… or, maybe not! I couldn’t tell you where the Fax app is now, I think it is the large pile of other discs and files that are waiting for something!?


Then, out of the blue an email, from the Government, I think. It was asking about something and gave options to reply, email, text, letter and Fax! I was so excited! I know, it doesn’t take much these days. I tried to remember where it was. I hunted and trawled through hundreds, if not thousands of files and there is was, the Fax folder, containing, you guessed, the Fax App! This had only taken a few days of my life, but now I was to get the reward due to me for purchasing that invaluable app! All that effort would now prove it’s worth. I reinstalled it!


‘This software is no longer supported by your computer’s Operating System! Please update?’ Not a problem, so I did. ‘Sorry, there are no new updates, or support for this version!’ ‘Please try our latest, World beating App, as verified by a group I had never heard of, and for today only, you can get it at a super low price, for the prime, starter package!’ Tempting, but I decided against it!


If I could have faxed them, I would have, but I decided to email and complain instead. No reply!


So, why am I going on about this outdated, none supported and useless Fax App? Well I realised that I am not alone and there must be millions with the same Fax app as me, but at the same time just as many with Fax apps by other companies too. While some of the better known, are still supported and have some limited connection, most, like mine are obsolete and long forgotten.


I then realised that this is so like dementia. There are millions of us throughout the World with our own copy of dementia, but while there is support and some connection for the more well known, like Alzheimer’s, lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemportal dementia, for the majority, there is none. While there is always this, the new and latest world beating research that has, just around the corner, the best new update ever, nothing yet! You see it is only the brand names that get the recognition, funding and support. If your particular type of dementia, doesn’t quite fit, then today’s Social Operating System, does not support it! We are alone and unconnected. I’ve heard over and over, of people with non specified, mixed, or what ever else they call it, dementia, that does not fit the particular requirements of the exclusive dementia club scene, finding that after six months, their so called support seems to dwindle and finally disappear.


Although for us, our copy, or type of dementia, is fully operational, reinstalled and updated daily, it has no real Social, or group support. We will remain as lost files, in forgotten folders.


We know that only the well known get the funding, and support, and we are told that there will be possible updates that may benefit the rest of us too. I’m so grateful, I will just sit here and wait!


Billions have been, and continue to be spent, without any treatments forth coming. If this is what is happening for the known dementia sufferers, what hope is there for the rest of us?


I no longer will accept being patronised with fleeting words, or scraps of maybe in the future, or someday!


I, as with all the other dementia sufferers, have fully functioning dementia today and our needs, need to be addressed by today’s Social Operating System. There are millions of us now and there will be many more tomorrow, if we don’t address this problem!


We are not demented fax machines!

It's a Grim Picture!,NotTooLate,2020-04-06T11:36:35+0100,0,"1 in 7 People With Alzheimer’s Lives Alone
New Report Paints Grim Picture
From the WebMD Archives

March 8, 2012 — One in seven people with Alzheimer’s disease lives alone.

This is one of the more stark findings from the 2012 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures, an annual report released by the Alzheimer’s Association.

I could not find any later report from the Alzheimer’s Association on the facts and figures.

The new report also looks at the costs of caring for people with Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia. In 2012, this cost will reach $200 billion.

According to the report, about 800,000 people with Alzheimer’s live alone, and as many as 50% of them don’t have an appointed caregiver.

This can happen for many reasons. “People become isolated, lose a spouse, or may choose to live alone in later life,” says William Thies, PhD. He is the chief medical and scientific officer for the Alzheimer’s Association.
		
Click to expand...



Firstly… this is no longer a, New Report. It is eight years old and we can say with certainty that the figures have increased!



I have found figures from a report by the, London School of Economics and Political Science.



Projections of older people with dementia and costs of dementia care in the UK 2019-2040








Let me clarify some points here… this report looks at people with dementia between the ages of 65 and over, in increments; 65-74, 75-84, 85+ You will not be surprised that as we get older, the rates of dementia increases.



It does not specify what is meant by Mild and Moderate, but it does use community care and care home services in its modelling, so I assume this must relate to those suffering with the severe forms of dementia.



If we look at 2020, the report says that 128,400 people will have mild symptoms of dementia and that is in the UK. How many would this equate too worldwide?



What happens to these people with mild dementia?



Do they go on to get Moderate and then Severe Dementia?
How long is this decline, if it is inevitable?
How many do live alone?
How many go on and live with their dementia without it progressing?
How many go on and change their dementia, by actions they take in their lives?


There is a massive and major mismatch between, the care, treatment and support given to mild and moderate sufferers of dementia and those that have severe dementia. It is predominantly towards support for those with Severe Dementia, because direct care is need for this group to survive.



For the Mild and Moderate group of dementia sufferers, there isn’t anything available to help. There is no medical treatment. This group is mainly coping to live alone. They may need some support and care, which comes from family and loved ones, but many will be coping totally alone.



If support was given, then maybe many symptoms of dementia could be slowed, stopped, or even reversed. What I have learned since my diagnosis, is that research seems to suggest this is true.


What a massive financial saving could be made, but more importantly, what a incredible difference to peoples’ lives. No longer this assumption that dementia is a one way ticket to a very lonely and frightening road to death, but something that can be treated and recovered from. I think the figures show, there are enough people suffering mild and moderate symptoms of dementia, that it has to be given a chance!



I am trying to reach out to others like me that are in that group that has hope.



I want to know how many of us there are out there and how many would like the chance to share ideas, thoughts, findings, suggestions and help build a support for those that have mild and moderate symptoms now, plus for those that will someday, the figures show, will be seeing the signs.



How do I start a campaign, how do I promote this idea, who can help?

Great news… Blogging is doing it! When I first started, my spelling was so bad, the grammar was no better and it was taking me forever to draft, redraft and check one last time before posting out there. I have a few close friends that check and it was embarrassing having the post come back with still so many errors. Now, my spelling is improving, of course the spell checker is helping, the grammar is improving a bit too and it’s not taking me so long. I seem to be able to go along with a thread in my head… that sounds like quite a good catch phrase! The best bit, the errors are not appearing nearly as so often. They’re still there, but I tell them I put them in deliberately, just to keep them on their toes.

This must mean that my brain is developing, adapting and improving, so it must be keeping me away for that dreaded edge of doom.

So, have a go! Maybe you don’t want to do a blog, but what about a story for the kids, an article for your local paper, a poem, a song, or even a real old fashioned letter to a friend?

These would be used as case studies, and would be completely anonymous.

The course is due to be delivered in April, so the deadline is the end of this month.

Please take a look at the questions below, and answer as many as you're able to. You can also PM me instead if you'd prefer.

Questions:

Have you thought what your future wishes might be?


Have you talked these through with anyone? This could be family, friends or an independent person.


What would make it easier for you plan your future?


If you have discussed it with someone, what helped? What didn’t help?


If someone else started the conversation with you, was there anything they did to help you to make the right choices for you? What could have been done better?


Have you found any particular information useful? This could be something online, leaflets, publications or face to face.


If you haven’t discussed your future with anyone, what would help you to do this?


Have you been offered this conversation?


Who would you want to support you?"

To see the tiredness in their eyes

And listen to their night time cries,

Is so very hard for some to do,

For the likes of me and you,







Dementias curse comes around,

Envelopes all, without a sound,

Yet anguished cries soon appear,

Along with temper and the tears,







You ask yourself so many times?

Have we committed such a crime?,

To bring this to our loving door,

And be cursed like this forevermore







Please take heart, you're not alone

Sitting by that silent phone,

Many more are just like you,

Bewildered, puzzled at what to do.



Please reach out, ask around,

So much info does abound,

So many people just like you

Asking all, what do I do?

The Angels Will Listen ???
(Verse 1)
When no one is around
To take you by the hand
And all that you can see
Is a dim and distant land
Looking forward sometimes
Is very hard to do
When everything becomes
Far too much for you
(Bridge)
There’s no need for anyone to sit alone and cry all night
Tell the whole wide world they’re welcome
And there is a guiding light
(Chorus)
Here at the purple angel
We will understand
So let us take your hand
Here at the purple angel
We will find a way
To help you through the day
(Verse 2)
The weight that you will carry
Deep within your mind
Is so very cruel
For those who are so kind
Even though dementia demons
Have come your way to stay
We will guide you through
Standing side by side
With you
(Bridge)
There’s no need for anyone to sit alone and cry all night
Tell the whole wide world they’re welcome
And there is a guiding light
(Chorus)
Here at the purple angel
We will understand
So let us take your hand
Here at the purple angel
We will find a way
To help you through the day
(Middle Eight)
Oh life is for living
Caring sharing and giving
So open your heart
Embrace who you are
(The angels will listen)
Oh we’re not worlds apart
No we’re not worlds apart
(Chorus)
Here at the purple angel
We will understand
So let us take your hand
Here at the purple angel
We will find a way
To help you through the day
Here at the purple angel
We will understand
So let us take your hand
Here at the purple angel
We will find a way
To help you through ?

Elaine : Come here and i will show you how to do it?

Me : It doesn't matter how many times you show me i wont remember, i wish i could!

Elaine : When we get there remind me we haven't got any washing powder left and need some
Me : Err, me remind you ??
Elaine: you have left the bathroom light on AGAIN !!
Me: i have dementia ! what am i supposed to do ?
And so it goes on, WHY ?? Because we are only Human. I know this won't be popular with some, but when i see the Do's and Don'ts lists of what to do when in the company of someone with dementia, do they REALLY think it happens like that in real life?? do they think that we are all THAT even tempered and have the patience of saints??
This applies to both those with dementia and carer`s alike. The list these people produce should be headed up as GUIDELINES only because with the best will in the world, when someone asks you the same question again and again it going to get on your nerves SIMPLE !!> I once wrote "" When i was first diagnosed, i thought the whole world was wrong and i was right as i kept getting told what i was doing or saying wasnt right !! Turns out the WHOLE WORLD was right and i was wrong!! But it took a diagnosis to realise this, and even then some dont believe it.
But i just wanted to assure all you incredible carers / carvivers / loved ones out there that it really is OK NOT TO BE OK and you WILL get frustrated and be short tempered, you are only HUMAN after all, and if anybody else tells you different they are LYING !!

I have Alzheimer's disease. I'm pretty high-functioning at the moment, but I'm on the same journey as your partners, mums and dads.
I see a lot of grief and heartache in the posts I read, and that's understandable; it's difficult to watch someone we love slip away. But please take solace in the fact that there is no pain for us when we slip into that other place where we are unaware of those around us. We are instead surrounded by those we knew at other times and in other places. We know you love us. Don't doubt it. And on behalf of all of my fellow dementia sufferers who are unable to articulate it, I'd like to say THANK YOU from the bottom of our hearts for all of the love and care you give us.
Never doubt that we know how hard it is for you, and we'd change things if we could, but we're fighting our battles too and we couldn't do it without your support.

Night terrors,Norrms,2020-01-21T09:01:59+0000,0,"Night terrors? warning signs not always visible

This night there was no warning of a bad night to come. Elaine my wife says usually there signs like myself twitching in my chair, arms jerking or my head darting from side to side as if I am looking for something just before I go to bed, but not this night.

Sleep came quickly as always but the darkness soon arrived, the darkness is what I call dementia itself. Within the deep recess of my mind, a battle was about to begin, my night terrors had arrived. no matter where I looked I saw it, (dementia) in the corner of my eye, following me, taunting me, calling me, mocking me. I began to run but it chased me, I hid in the shadows, but it was there, only feet away, snarling, clawing away at my sanity. it was only a matter of yards away, and then it happened, I turned and faced it, looked it in the eye and summoned strength I never thought I had, It was time........

I took a deep breath and ran towards it, screaming, shouting hoping it would disappear, but it just stood its ground. I got closer and closer, it seemed an age before I reached it and as I did, my arms came up, my fists clenched and my legs kicked, I screamed, clawed punched and kicked as hard as I could, I was relentless, pounding and pounding its grotesque shape hopefully into submission, I felt something wrap around my legs first, then my arms, until I could hardly move, still screaming hurtful obscene comments at dementia, I wriggled and struggled to escape my restraints but to no avail.

My eyes opened so very slowly at first, still trying to get me bearings and still struggling to get free from whatever it was that was holding me. As all became clear I saw the incredible beautiful eyes of Elaine, holding me tight, she had somehow managed to wrap me in the sheet and held me firmly, she had my legs held in like a scissor lock with her own legs until eventually I slowed to a halt and realized it was once again one of my night terrors. We held each other for so long, strangely, at first, for a minute I didn't want to be unwrapped from the sheet, I felt safe, and I also knew, MORE IMPORTANTLY, so was Elaine, OMG WHAT IF ????? WHAT IF ???? The thought still makes me shiver even now as I write. The thought of accidentally hurting someone I love and adore so much makes me sick to the stomach. We have talked about separate beds but Elaine always says not just yet, and for that and her bravery I love her so very much. Elaine was a Professional carer for 30 years plus before finishing to look after me, and has so much experience in this, but what of the others?? What of those with no experience of anything like this, those who didn't ask to become carers, yet are, those wonderful incredibly brave people who walk this earth ??

Those are the people I write this for, they are the ones dedicate this too as I hope to help them understand that its the illness and not the person who acts like this, and more importantly

YOU ARE NOT ALONE

A bad night = a bad day,Norrms,2020-01-05T10:25:16+0000,0,"A bad day always follows a bad night


As you know i had such a bad night on Friday, that was followed by a horrendous day yesterday (thankfully last night was a little better Elaine says).


After i bad night i feel so detached, so away from it, hard to explain really but its really is like i am watching all thats going on around but i am not really there, so very surreal, my moods are low and swing from lower to lower,. I sat in the car and watched the world go by and yet,? I felt as if i didnt belong and was in a very strange place. Elaine asked what i was doing with my hands as they were making strange movements and signals but i had no answer, just very confused.


The day just seemed to melt into one and every now and again i would shout out as a Night terror came thundering back into focus and just for a second i was back in the Horrific world that is dementia's nightmare.This is just a snapshot of my day and there are many out there a lot worse than me who have to go through this regularly and daily and my heart will forever go out to them and their carers.
As always, and something we must never forget is there is two sides to every story, and as bad as it is for us with dementia, please spare a thought of all loved ones and carers who have to try and make sense of all this when it must not only seem impossible to do but also whats happening makes no sense whatsoever to them or anybody else who see us act in the way we do.

I have not been diagnosed yet,Madcap,2020-01-27T15:16:36+0000,0,"but maybe it’s time to visit my GP.  I had radiotherapy and chemo 18 months ago and I tell myself it’s chemo brain and it will clear up, but it’s not happening.
I’m confused and very forgetful. I spend ages hunting for for everyday objects, where’s my phone, my purse, my specs etc.  I forget recent events and people’s names. I’ve given up reading because I forget the plot. I can’t find things in supermarkets.  Same with TV dramas that go on for lots of episodes.

Changes in writing,KenC,2009-06-25T20:47:47+0100,0,"Recently it has be noticeable that my writing and spelling has changed. So after speaking to my consultant it was suggested that I wrote a topic out and then went back to check and correct it.

Believe me it started off fine but then developed into something that was out of this world. I know my spelling has gone out of the window. But in the end there were words that I could not work out what they were supposed to be.

I have always been right handed, but due to my job as an engineer, I learnt to use both hands, now a major part of the problem is caused by my left hand becoming faster than my right.

This means that most of the letters in a word are there, but in the wrong order. I have now started to double up on the wrong letters in some words which is giving me a lot of stress, and I just can not understand what is happening inside my head. A word like letters, becomes ""leeterrs"" or something similar, and other times letters are completely missing from words or words missing from sentences.

I know dementia causes havoc, but there are times when I think I  am trying to write in a foreign language and if it were not for things like spell check I would be totally lost.

I now understand how frustrating people feel when they lose the ability to write or use the computer through this illness, and my heart goes out to them.

WHEN TWO WORLDS COLLIDE,Norrms,2019-12-20T10:09:49+0000,0,"WHEN TWO WORLD`S COLLIDE
DEMENTIA AND FAMILY LIFE


When two world`s collide there is an awful mess, of that you can be sure of. The two worlds I am talking about are Dementia and Family Life, but make no mistake, when they do, there is no big explosion, no huge build up and when they collide it doesn’t go BANG !! It just splinters, with a crack, or a snap, and here’s why…….
If you can imagine a piece of wood that you break over your knee, and it doesn’t quite snap but cracks and leaves the jagged ends protruding yet still clings on as one piece of wood, then that’s close enough. The jagged pieces of wood are the person who has dementia, broken, splintered into many different lengths, some long, some short, meaning his / her life is in pieces, yet there are still parts of them clinging on. The piece of splintered wood also depicts family life as well, because what was once strong is now split as family members disagree on what to do, how to do it, and sometimes, some, even go into denial as if the disease doesn’t exist!!


When the person with dementia splinters they become confused and disorientated. They feel as if there’s bits of them everywhere, some good days (long bits) some bad days (Short bits) and some days when they have no idea what’s going on (Bits on the floor) they feel so alone and broken.


As for the family, the Crack or the Snap when the wood first break`s is a shock, at first they can’t believe what they are seeing. Should they have seen it before? Should they have seen the wood bending to a point where it was obvious it was going to break? Not always as sometimes the wood can bend so far, be so flexible that you put your trust in it that all will be OK, until that is, it breaks and splinters, and when it does, family members are the long and short bits of jagged wood, some understanding, some, unfortunately not.
Now the question is, can the piece of wood be fixed? So the two worlds that have collided can come together as one? Sadly no, well, not as yet as we know of, but with love, care and an understanding of this awful disease they can be pushed gently together for a short time so all the broken pieces slot together and become nearly new again. The piece of wood is forever broken, as are the family and the person with dementia unless there’s a cure found, but until then, by working together, by helping each other and by knitting together those shards of wood so they match as well as they can for the time being, we can help the broken become workable again, just in a different way

If just for a short time

Last week as a very strange one for me, but I think it was part of the process of coming to terms with my diagnosis.
We decided to let our families know (not my the youngest three), which wasn't an easy thing to do, but not as was bad as I thought......
Then Monday came along, and with my kids at school and my wife at work I found myself in a strange place, knowing that my demise is going to be a lot sooner than anticipated..
I couldn't focus on my basic daily tasks such as cleaning, laundry etc which and was getting a bit upset due to the real possibility that I'll not be there for their big occassions such as , marriage,  graduation, my grandchildren etc.

my wife and I had a long and emotional discussion about our thoughts around this, and thankfully, I think we are both in a better place now.

we do understand that things may not pan as we would hope,but we should be able to talk to them about it and what to expect.

Life just keeps throwing big barrels of smelly stuff at you...,TEEDEE62,2019-11-07T19:50:39+0000,0,"As alluded to in my post/rant earlier today, my diagnosis was just another challenge that has no rules, limits of guarantees.
I'll try to keep this brief......

1993 aged 31,  I had a heart attack..a family traitfollowed by a stent in 2022 and a further 5 stents in 2014.

In late 2015, I was made redundant and two weeks later diagnosed with bladder cancer(2 high grade tumours ) which were removed and I had 3 years of immunotherapy and I've had no recurrence.
In 2017, following a hearing nerve scan, I was found to have an aneurism in my brain which was in a place where it was too dangerous to operate on , so I get annual scans to monitor it.

In mid 2018 I had the wonderful gift of a very serious infection of my prostrate caused by the Immunotherapy which has left me with chronic prostatitis

"Lewy Bodys, Nobody knows",Norrms,2019-11-03T09:52:39+0000,0,"Nobody knows, KNOW BODY KNOWS !!!

During the night last night,, i sat up in my bed, i looked down and saw my wife who was sleeping peacefully besides me, apparently unaware that the computer screen was flashing on and off. I sat upright in bed and rubbed my eyes as it flashed and flashed, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, then the screen came on a brilliant white.

After a few seconds i was just about to get up to see what was going on when all sorts of jumbled up letters began appearing across the screen, jetting backwards and forwards, not making any sense , not making any word's, just random letters zig zagging up and down. Then the zig zagging stopped and a sentence appeared, i strained my eyes to see what it said and the sentence just grew bigger and bigger, then it started to roll down like an old fashioned music box on top of an old piano that used to play music by itself, i couldnt believe my wife hadn't even moved as she is such a light sleeper.

Then, just as i made a move to get out of bed , i felt it. It was only light at first but then felt like something was grabbing me .It felt so small, almost like a baby's hands, then another , then another, until all i could feel were tiny hands clawing at the small of my back and sides, nipping me, scratching me and even more terrifying trying to pull me into the mattress below!! My own hands went around the back of me as i tried to swat the hands away, i looked at the computer screen which was going crazy now, and all sorts of noises were coming from it. I SCREAMED , and SCREAMED again, and then? As quickly as it had happened, it stropped, and Elaine was by my side holding me, reassuring me and telling me it was all a hallucination. I could do nothing but shake and weep for the next ten minutes saying over and over again ""Nobody Knows, NO BODY KNOWS !!!!!!, Whilst Elaine held me.

i have been through this so many times of late, once even in the afternoon a couple of weeks ago whilst out and about and it never gets any easier, some i re-member, some i dont, this one has stayed with me all day and even as i type i can almost feel the hands around my waist and it makes me shudder.

Dementia is a Curse

LEWY BODY`S is a Curse

And sometimes, so is life,

But we have to remember these are the cards i have been dealt. So many have gone before me have lost their life to this GOD AWFUL Disease and who have not been diagnosed as half as long as me. I HAVE To believe its all about the quality of life we HAVE at the moment, take it day by day, hour by hour sometimes, and be grateful for each moment, because as sure as eggs are eggs (Unless they find a cure) the good times will not always be there as i sink below what really is the quagmire of dementia.

We know we have so far to go yet, would be foolish to think otherwise, but sometimes we must reflect on how far we have come and how many changes there have been for the better, we really have and we must not forget this. Far to often we hear the gloom and doom, and how things haven't changed but they really have.
Attitudes have changed for the better, memory cafes all over the world, people talking openly about it, More TV coverage, people with dementia being employed again. people with dementia being asked their opinion and so so much more.
To all who have been a part of this, THANK YOU VERY much and please dont lose sight of how far we have come.

Elaine asks, Whats Wrong ??
Me: Dont know 
Elaine, How do you feel ?
Me: Dont know, just not well
Elaine , In what way not well ?

Me, Can't explain it, dont feel right, feel detached, feel lost, feel like all around me is collapsing, feeling of dread and worry, feels like something bads going to happen, a little confused, sad, anxious and so frustrated .

Elaine, WHY ?

Me Cant explain ........

And so it goes on, so many mixed up feeling`s when you have dementia, so much going on in your head, so many flashbacks of times past, worries of times to come, feeling of impending doom, trying to put on a brave face for all but knowing deep inside your dying, bit by bit.

Every time someone reminds you of something you have forgotton, knowing that bit is gone forever, never to return, another minute, another hour another day of wondering what's going to happen next.

And yet ???

All this time we try to explain to loved ones how we are feeling at the time

STOP BEING SO SELFISH,Norrms,2019-10-03T08:59:26+0100,0,"STOP BEING SO SELFISH >>>>>

I was once asked since being diagnosed with dementia years, would you go back and try to change anything ?? My answer was simple, YES I would, and it is this!!

I would go back a few years and tell myself to stop being so ****** Selfish, and here's why.

Ok, so when I was first diagnosed I threw my toys out of the pram shouting WHY ME?, I was only 50 years old and had already lost my Gran and Father to dementia and I was fuming. A couple of years earlier I had to retire with heart failure and this was another blow that shook me off my feet.

But what I didn't realise at the time, and do now, was how selfish I had been, because as I got worse I flatly refused to have any care, any help from anybody else which meant Elaine had to do it all herself. Looking back now, i always think, how could I do this to someone who has loved me, supported me, stood by me through thick and thin for all these years and expect her now to take up the strain all by herself, HOW SELFISH is that!!

I know hindsight is a wonderful thing they say and at that time I used the words ""Babysitter"" and was very adamant I could manage on my own when I quite clearly couldn't as in the past i have nearly set the kitchen on fire three times (Not that I am a bad cook I may add!!) But I just couldn't see why anybody of my age would need a person of similar age, for the want of a better word, Babysitting "" me, I was having none of it, until ?????

Until one day I caught Elaine crying with exhaustion and Elaine is not one to cry, you also have to remember that Elaine also had 35 years as a professional carer under her belt, but when it's one of your own ?? when you cant clock off and go home ?? it's such a different matter.

If I am very honest I have never forgiven myself for that, and believe me, even then it wasn't easy, I had about 5 different carers in 6 months until Peter came along nearly three years ago now. He inspired me to fall in love with fishing, he taught me what I know about fishing and now just love it when Elaine gets HER time with family and friends and I can get out and about as well.

So YES I would tell myself to stop being so ****** selfish and think about others this disease affects, not just yourself.

Much love

Only joking about the drunkenness bit... only true some of the time.... just try to show the example of conflicting research.

I'm taking Omega 3 LPC.. containing 600mg EPA and 440mg of DHA.

There are loads of companies, that you may never of heard of before, now producing, or just selling this type of Omega 3 type product.

In March 2019 WRAD was our Biggest yet, 20+ countries around the world joining in with over 120 events and raising awareness of dementia to millions across the globe. The MP3 campaign has gone from Strength to Strength starting in care homes, supplying to people who live at home,, then spreading to hospitals (we now supply 27 NHS trusts across the UK ) and now we have South West Ambulances using them with another Ambulance service in the pipeline who want to do the same AND carry the Purple Angel logo on some Ambulances
A few moths ago BBC asked us to help them with their national music day and even though i do owe you all an apology as i didnt envisage the paperwork that goes with it (IT WILL NEVER Happen with WRAD ""World rock against dementia events I PROMISE, i dont do tickboxing or paperwork as you know, lol LOL there are now more Purple Angel Connected events happening in the Uk for this than anybody else (Allegedly, i have to say that as i haven't got exact figures but i`m almost sure lol, dont you just love the PC lot LOL )
On a more local level the Support coming out of Cornwall in the last few month`s has gone through the roof !! All thanks to my wonderful; Co Founder Jane Moore and the Wonderful Lynn Bartrip-Kay and the Newquay Purple Angel campaign.
The support we get from everybody is just incredible and far too many to mention but i cannot let this year so far go pass without mentioning Jean Saunders and her team,Tony Hall all the purple Angel Ambassadors in the UK and worldwide, and of course Not forgetting the incredible Mandie Giles who has downloaded 1000`s and 1000`s of songs onto the Mp3s we have sent out that have brought so much peace and joy to so many, dont worry Gilly Barton, i`m not forgetting you for taking over the packing and posting from Mandie Giles and also our wonderful newshound Heather Pearson for keeping us up to date with everything
I am so sure there are so many people not listed on here and things that have happened as well, and for that i am sorry, but please know that its YOU that are at the heart of this, its YOU that makes the Difference and its YOUR support that keeps us going.

The lows of lewy Bodys,Norrms,2019-09-06T10:41:58+0100,0,"The incredible lows of dementia

Without sounding paranoid I am convinced even more now that Dementia is a living breathing evil entity. It waits until you have had a good few days only to drag you down to its level in the depths of hell and torments you, baits you and taunts you relentlessly. We see many people who are very ill and they seem to perk up for a while before once again becoming gravely ill, I am convinced dementia is no different.
Within the hour of my head hitting the pillow, Elaine says, the screaming started and went on for most of the night, finishing with me sat up in bed, the bedroom bathed in daylight, sobbing my heart out and a complete mess.

THIS IS THE REALITY OF DEMENTIA

I make no excuses or have no shame in saying because of my Lewy body`s i suffer very badly from depression and I am on the highest amount of Fluoxetine that can be allowed. The physical downside of this is whilst I am conscious I am almost unable to weep.

AND YET

When dementia visits me at night it's so severe it seems to bypass this, Goodness knows how and turns me into a complete jabbering wreck.
Today will be a quiet day, today will be a solemn one, and yet even today i will try my best to fight my way out of the concrete overcoat dementia has wrapped around me once again

I could not except this and looked for reasons why they were wrong. However, as the support progressed at the Juniper Centre staff, especially with one psychologist... I think that is what he was... who was very direct, honest and explained it all to me, and my family, and answered any questions. With the realisation that what had developed was true, I was aware of this thing eating away at me.. I started to accept the inevitable, but if I had dementia.. . would I know I have it?

Different Doors ?? same rooms,Norrms,2019-05-07T08:23:39+0100,0,"DIFFERENT DOORS ?? SAME ROOMS

Hello and welcome to my Brain, please follow me through this door and have a look around. What ? you can see many more doors? Yes, of course, you can, because a person with dementia has many parts to their brain just like anybody else does, the thing is it's not always the same what's behind my doors as it is yours. What ?? you want to go into that room ?? Ok then, though that door is a happy place, that's where I store all my music and stuff, its a bit like having a Mp3 player in my head and I try to stay in this room as much as possible.

What's next door ?? Well, that's the only one that`s private as its where my family and friends live in my mind, so many things over the years that have happened are in there, some good, some not so good, but all very private. WAIT!!!! You can't go in that one!! That's the dark place of my mind, where it all goes wrong and bad things happen. There is no light in this room as it mostly happens at night but if you look down at the floor you will see scratch marks and skid marks where dementia drags me in kicking and screaming, the door shuts behind me and sometimes its so hard to get out, there are times I wonder if I will ever get back to my family room or music room.

Why don't you go through the door on your left, that's an interesting one as it changes shape. Sometimes its a very long room with no end in sight and yet other times it's just a short walk to where i want to get to, just as in life, dementia is a funny thing at times, and i don't mean humorous. The room over to your left as you can see has a sign that says ""Here lies the Unknown behind this door"" This is a room of total confusion, the one i find myself in many times and without knowing how i got there, and the thing is, when I find myself out of this room I have no idea how I got out either !!

The last room with the black door is one I have not been in myself yet, and yet? I feel as if I have, I feel it`s a very familiar place, a place of peace and tranquillity but also a place of fear, or a fear of being in there.

FOOTNOTE

A person who has dementia has just as many doors and rooms in their brain as anybody else, the only difference is , what's behind those doors and what's in those rooms. Some rooms as you can see are just the same as yours, some are not, and those that are not ???

THEY ARE JUST ROOMS AFTER ALL !!!

Where is everyone?,NotTooLate,2019-05-09T11:45:07+0100,0,"These are statistics I have just read on AS Site:

There are 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, with numbers set to rise to over 1 million by 2025. This will soar to 2 million by 2051.

225,000 will develop dementia this year, that’s one every three minutes.

1 in 6 people over the age of 80 have dementia.

70 per cent of people in care homes have dementia or severe memory problems.

There are over 40,000 people under 65 with dementia in the UK.

More than 25,000 people from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups in the UK are affected.

I thought everyone would be like me when diagnosed, would be running around trying to find out all the information, help and advice that was out there.... grasping for hope... but I'm not sure they are... so why not?

I noticed that there are less than 59.000 registered here... this is a large number, but is this an accumulative number, the number of people that have registered since AS site was set up? How many active members are there?

4. Elevating supply of neurotrophic factors for neuroplasticity and neurogenesis.

This all sounds great and very positive, but when I asked about exercising... I didn't get a much of a response... more of a.. Yeah if you want to!?

I believe that becoming physically and mental less active is detromental to everyone but, especially for those with dementia. In fact I think physical and mental activity should be increased, varied and as wide as possible,  as soon as dementia is recognised. I think if you don't use it your lose it... and for us it's about losing our mind!

So what do you think.... should I take up Salsa?"

WHAT IF ???

He ran towards me, raining blow after blow about my head and body, never letting up, never running out of breath, I dodged and swayed but nothing seemed to put him off. I knew I needed just the one opportunity, the one gap that would let me in, all I needed was to land that ONE PUNCH that would finish him, I bobbed, I weaved, and then there it was, the gap I had been looking for. I pulled my arm back and with every muscle and sinew in my body, I was just about the let fly, WHEN ???

There she was, my Angel Elaine stood in front of me, gently trying to bring me out of this hallucination i was having, calling my name, urging me to come back to real life, real time.

Then it hit me, OMG WHAT IF !!! OH SWEET LORD WHAT IF ????

Something like this ACTUALLY happening HAUNTS me every second of every single day and always will. 

DEAR LORD PLEASE NEVER LET IT HAPPEN

I've spoken to a physiatrist about depression I've been going through for roughly 5-6 years now, but the memory problems along with lots of other things are starting to frighten me. I've had panic attacks from a young age but not often anymore, until recently. I want to ignore my problems and pretend they don't exist like I've done so far, but I'm terrified. My memory is getting worse, it's getting difficult to read (especially when there's a grammar mistake, I get caught up on it for some time and I have to keep scanning back through what I've read), even now writing this I can't think of what I want to write. It's like, when I want to explain something to someone, I blank completely, but in my own time, in my own head I can string the words I need together. I keep thinking I see people or faces moving, or hearing quiet sounds that aren't there and I get pretty scared over it if I'm on my own. I have so much more I want to say but I can't get the words together on my head. Not even enough to know. Things just reoccur to me when I'm thinking. It's like pressure building in the front and side of my brain when I try to remember things but I'm being blocked. I've never written on a forum before so sorry if I was meant to sort paragraphs etc. to make it easier to read. I'm just not myself tonight. I'm stuck. A lot of things going on and I can't take anything in. Work, family problems, my own problems (physically and mentally). My whole life I wanted to keep any problems I had to myself, and my dad kind of reinforced that. Any time I had a problem I'd have to either fix it myself, or try to ignore it.

NeuroGenesis... my next read....,NotTooLate,2019-05-06T15:05:15+0100,0,"I'm sure there are more of you out there who read everything you can about dementia; it does become your life and takes over!

Anyway, I've just got my next book... The Neurogenesis Diet and Lifestyle.

I'm not promoting this book in anyway! This is not an endorsement! It me just telling you what I'm reading.

Neurogenesis... made up of to greek words.... which is the thing in all sorts of science, makes it sound better. Neurogenesis .... Neuro = Nerve and Genesesis = Creation

So this book is about,  the relatively new theory,  the creation of Nerves Cells.

Up until the late 1990... it was an established fact that nerve cells.... in the brain stopped being created after you were about 20. After that they started a steady road of decline. 

It is now believed that nerve cells continue to be created all our lives and if this is true, it could be a big plus for us with dementia!

There is research that shows that nerve cells grow and there is research that say they don't, but over the last 5 years much more research is being done on Neurogenesis, so fingers crossed it is positive.

The main area of research is in nerve creationists in the Hippocampus.... this is basically the control centre to our continually thinking brain and is vital for learning, memory, spacial awareness and mood etc. Damage to the Hippocampus is a major factor in dementia, in varying degrees. In Alzheimer's it is one of the first regions to be affect.  So you can see why they want to carry out this research. 

If pharmaceutical companies can produce a drug that promotes neurogenesis... well this would be of interest to everyone and I think they would make a view pounds!

The research that seems to be in the news along side Neurogenesis is that of Neuroplasticity, but that is my next research project. 

By the way! Hippocampus is another one of those created words from Greek... 
apparently it means Seahorse..
Doesn't quite have the same ring to it... 'The old Seahorse has gone a bit haywire!'"
Let's Get Familiar!,NotTooLate,2019-05-06T10:40:32+0100,0,"I keep hearing... everyone is different and every case is different... and I become adhered to that rhetoric!

Now I think we have it it the wrong way around... maybe!?

We are all different... the millions of variables that got us here in the first place and then the billions and billions of different cells that form us. The brain alone is billions of neurones connecting via trillions of synapse, meaning that we all think and look different.. This is the basic things that makes us, us but... I think there are more we have in common between us than the differences. I would like to think so!

As for dementia....well I went through many tests, scans and medical procedures, over a long time, while the doctors' ticked their little boxes... and finally, when enough of the little boxes were ticked... the diagnoses. This procedure is the same for us all.... it is familiar I'm sure, whether you are the patient, or carer!?

There does have to be an establish criteria, a check list!

The only problem I see in this is that everyone is then treated the same, or I should say, the care is thought of as being the same. I mean without regard for the individual.. Family members will know their loved ones, but they will reading all the information, all the leaflets at the hospital and all the advice professionals give out and maybe trying things that seems to be the right thing to do, as the leaflet says, but is it ritght for the individual? 

Some of the things I get offered, suggested, or pushed into, believing that they are good for me and it is because it is a familiar thing that all dementia patients do... scare the hell out of me! Simply put... these things are just not me... I wouldn't have done them before I was diagnosed, so why do you they assume that it is what I need now!?

It has to be easier if the same thing can be done for everyone... saves money and time, so a one fix for all has got to be the right way to go! I say NO!    I get things bought and brought to me in the believe that as they are... designed to meet the needs of dementia patients, will be just what I need... there are lots of things sold... and are very expensive... can't mention what..... I'm sure you will have come across them, or know the sort of thing I talking about....

It also seems to me that many of these things are designed to pacify rather than stimulate... soupifying the brain!

I think there are lots of familiar things that are common to any of us that suffer some form of dementia, but  what I think is not so familiar is the needs and lifestyle of the person prior to their dementia, being taken in consideration with the care given after.

I think most of us like our own space.... where we can be ourselves without trying to pretend to be ok, or different. Some of us like company, while others do not. What I like, music, telly, books reading, or not, maybe completely different to anyone else. I like to eat this and go to bed in my time and the list goes on... I'm sure you can think of many things!?

I write every day... it started many years ago when I started having memory related problems, but was still teaching. I found I had to write things down to retain them and then I could think about them, edit and re-edit my thoughts. This is what I still do today and it is apart of me. It is my way of talking to to myself, something we all do, but I write it down. I make notes of things that pop up in my head for no particular reason and then later this will become part of my daily writing/thinking thing! It is how I came up with the post to you.

Now, I'm sure is not normal for most people and this is just one thing... I do.... I find getting on with people harder now.. strangers send me into a bit of a panic... don't know why, they just do... Going out...strange place another problem! My eating habits have changed dramatically and my personal care, is for me to know!

We do have familiarities with our dementia, but we are all individuals and this should be carefully considered when offering care....Get Familiar!....  wherever that care comes from!"
Professionals here to help?,NotTooLate,2019-05-02T08:47:44+0100,0,"I often want to get an answer to a question and only get confusing, conflicting, or replies in a language that makes no sense to me... medical jargon etc!

As AS supports and funds research, I was wondering if these researchers share this online space and would they be up for answering questions?

Such as:

Can Amyloid Plaques been seen on a scan, or is it only the dark space that shows where there are no live brain cells for the scan to detect?

The reason I'm asking this question; 
 A system used in scanning, now compares scans to scans of know dementia patients. These patients were known to have Amyloid Plaques in the brain, in those dark spaces. The inference is then, if the your scan, is like the controlled scan... you have Amyloid Plaques. Only after death can this be truly determined."

Mini Me can not keep control of everything to do with Me; even communication is more often than not, one way. It is Mini Me that is here now, writing this post, because it is the only way I get to tell anyone what is happening in my World. Mini Me has time to think, plan, edit, re-edit, read and re-read, take the time to process my thoughts and then my fingers do the typing! Me and Mini Me are in a constant battle...

Surf you way to health!,NotTooLate,2019-05-02T09:16:07+0100,0,"Just watching the BBC news and another surprising medical breakthrough! Kids with mental problems, like depression benefit from going off and spending their time surfing! Amazing!

Wouldn't everyone benefit and going off and doing something different... maybe not surfing, but singing, painting, writing, going for a walk in the park!? Does this sound familiar? 

I have a question about those kids.... what happens when they are not surfing? 

I'm a big believer in doing things different in your life. Changing the humdrum and stimulating the old grey cells into action. I used to teach and although for me this was the best job in the World, there were days that I was bored out of my skull! I'm sure everyone know this feeling, but how many people do anything about it!? It is my belief that if you don't change things and continue is the constant drudgery, you brain start to power down switch off and settles to just do the minimum it can.

I think mental health  problems being solved by a quick fix may work for some, but if we all started surfing our brains everyday, introducing new things to think about. This would force our brains to re-energise and be forced to be forced work and not slumber. As a way to maintain one of the main function of our brains, I think daily activities, away from the daily grind,  would build those new connections and stimulate the regrowth of brain cells. That has got to be good, hasn't it!? 

How many people do the same thing, day in and day out!?

Everyday I write, mainly dribble, but it's my dribble, I paint, or draw, I try juggling, I do some handwriting, I can no longer use my right hand, I go in the garden and trying and name the weeds, I listen to music, I do some memory training, I play the ukulele, or try and I come on here and see what is happening!

I don't do much singing... my neighbour's and Finn complain! They got no taste!

I do everything I can to keep my brain working, if I become bored I start something new... I'll try anything as long as it stops me from sitting here letting my brain... atrophy, because when I do, I think of only one thing... my dementia.

I know that every case is different.

It seems that as our brain cells die, our brain tries to cope by regeneration, or reconfiguring, but then it gets to a point that there are not enough brain cells left to cope. Brain cells seem to die exponentially and this could be the reason for the rapid decline.

Is there a Tipping Point?"

I was finally diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease last Friday. What a relief!
I've been off work for nearly a year with anxiety after suffering a series of nervous breakdowns, and I knew in my heart that my cognitive functions were deteriorating, even though I passed every memory test.

Well, a brain scan has shown that there is shrinkage in my hippocampi (if indeed that is the plural of hippocampus), and that has answered most of the questions that had been plaguing me for a long time.

Now it's time for me to put a regime in place to try and hold back the process of deterioration for as long as possible, and for that, I'm looking for the wisdom and support of all the lovely people here on Talking Point.

Yes it's scary, but knowledge is power and I will fight this illness every step of the way. and I'm looking forward to interacting with you all.

Sometimes the conversation just dies, oh ! it doesn't finish, oh no, it's just that the words being spoken to me turn to gibberish and I can't understand them, they sound so different and its as if I am being spoken to in another language. Can you imagine how frustrating that is ?? There you are listening and watching a great film and then slowly, the language turns to nonsense until eventually, you have no understanding of what's going on? Or your company and there is a really good conversation going around, and just when you want to join in ?? It all goes wrong as you completely lose the thread, and then, to make matters worse, you can't remember what was being said in the first place.
Also the other evening i was watching something but just couldn't get my head around it. I squinted at the TV and must have looked very studious. Elaine turned to me and said ""Norms? Are you ok? You look puzzled? I tried to say what i wanted but couldn't, and when I did, it kind of came out like,
"""" Prnkiclaynbs """"

Last night the night terrors and hallucinations came thick and fast, all night, never letting up.

The tiredness that you feel in the morning is sometimes overwhelmed with ""The Fear"".

What i mean by that is the feeling of dread and anticipation that something really bad is going to happen, it runs through your body like cold ice and has you on edge most of the day, then suddenly ""WHAM"" there is a flashback !! A scene from last nights terrors that flash in front of your eyes and appears with no warning, its like your there all over again but this time during the day, you jump, shout, scream, it doesn't matter where you are, indoors, outdoors, in a cafe, it matters not but its oh so very real, and when the terrors/ hallucinations you have are so graphic its like its happening in real time.

Those that don't understand (And its not their fault as it's all about education ) look over, shake their heads, tut or even worse shout something deroggative at you (yes its happened)n which doesn't help you when your in such a state of confusion, but as I say its all about educating others. this disease is so complex, affect so many pepole in so many ways its no wonder they ate struggling to find a cure.

Dementia Action Week 2019: how does living with dementia affect you?,HarrietD,2019-04-05T16:41:35+0100,0,"Hi everyone,

We've had the below request from our Engagement and Participation team. Please do take part in their survey if you're able to.

*

Ahead of Dementia Action Week, Alzheimer’s Society is undertaking a survey to find out how living with dementia affects people across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This survey will help us make change happen and improve the lives of people living with dementia.

To make a difference to those living with dementia, we need to share this survey with as many people with dementia as we can. More survey responses will help our findings have more influence - allowing us to raise awareness of the issues that really matter to people with dementia.

We would really appreciate it if you could also share this survey with anyone you know with dementia who would like to make their voice heard - the information you need for this is below. Thank you, we really value your support.

How do I take part? 

If you are a person living with dementia, we would like you to answer this survey. There are three parts.

To complete the survey, go to our survey page.

Next, choose to complete either questions about living in your local community, living with dementia day to day, or about employment and work.

The survey should be simple and easy to complete. Please complete the survey by 5pm on Thursday 25 April 2019.

To find out more about how we use and look after your personal information and your rights in relation to it, please see our service user and supporter privacy statement.

A note for carers

Please note this survey will be solely collecting the views of people living with dementia. If the person with dementia you care for needs help filling out the survey, please do assist them.

*

If you'd prefer to complete the paper version instead of online, please email talkingpoint@alzheimers.org.uk and we'll send this to you.

Thanks so much for your help."

An 86-year-old woman who has passed her advanced driving test with flying colours says she wants to challenge stereotypes of older motorists.

Thelma Bradshaw, from Alvaston, Derby, is one of the oldest women in the UK to pass the test.

The Institute of Advanced Motorists' test examines a higher level of skills than the standard practical driving exam.

Mrs Bradshaw first passed in 1977 but she decided to take it again to prove she still could.

This time, she was just one mark short of a perfect score.

Unfortunately, People like myself have to put up with the looks, nudges, and nods, just like many others with disabilities but we also live in fear if you have dementia, fear of the SHADOWMAN because we never know when he will appear and what he will do. So who is he ? what is he ? and why does this happen ??
I imagine only Dementia itself can answer these questions

WHEN IS THE WORLD GOING TO WAKE TO DEMENTIA,Norrms,2019-02-05T11:01:34+0000,0,"WHEN IS THE WORLD GOING TO WAKE UP TO DEMENTIA?
Hello, my name is norrms Mc Namara, Founder of the Global purple Angel dementia campaign which started right here in Torquay Devon UK,
https://www.purpleangel-global.com/world-rocks-against-dementia.html
With friends across the world, this year will be our Fourth WRAD "" World rocks against dementia"""" As you can see with our latest attachment and information i have sent here, its becoming bigger and bigger every year. This has now become a Global phenomenon and YET??
it gets very little publicity and more worrying some, not all i may add, Large UK dementia and worldwide dementia organizations choose to ignore this. This is a very sad state of affairs by all connected or touched with dementia. If we all joined in, made a little bit more of an effort and asked all we know to join in with this we could do so much more good. We have long said the only way to beat this disease is by working together, so why don't you / they work with us on this ??
There is nothing political about joining in with this, it takes very little time to send a generic email to all and ask them to confirm they will be joining in and then letting us know. The more people are involved, the more those with dementia will know we are thinking about them and helping them in their worst time.
I would appreciate e reply to this e mail please and if you want to know anything else about QWRAD 2019 March 23rd (or that week) please don't hesitate to get in touch

HOW MANY DONT KNOWS DOES IT TAKE?,Norrms,2019-01-20T15:31:02+0000,0,"How many DONT KNOWS does it take ??

E... ""You must know how you feel?

ME... Don't Know!

And so it goes on. this will sound very familiar I think to those who look after someone with dementia and the truth is sometimes WE DONT KNOW! No matter how many times we are asked there are no answers because no answers will come to mind. you see we know we are ill and we know we get confused, though sometimes we don't remember why. The frustration hits the boiling point and BANG all hell lets loose and it all comes out

""I`m Useless
I Hate this
I can't do anything anymore
I am of no use to you anymore
I`m just a burden
My life is over
I want everything to go away

Once again, so on and so on, and sometimes even much worse, but please, believe me, that's just the frustration coming out. and more importantly ITS NOT YOUR FAULT !!! You, meaning Carers loved ones etc, do what you do and do it so very well, you possibly couldn't do anymore and its so appreciated, but sometimes we forget that because 1, we have dementia and 2, cannot see a way out of this, because unfortunately there is no way out of it, and?
THATS THE MOST FRUSTRATING BIT
Please Know we really don't mean it, and if anybody thinks its all Roses and Wine in our House
THINK AGAIN !!! Either that or ask those closest to us
Hope this helps, Please share

The fear Of whats to come,Norrms,2018-12-12T09:57:09+0000,0,"The FEAR of what's to come......

Sitting there, so tired, so sleepy, yet fighting it every inch. Eyes closing, lids so heavy then JUMP!! trying to snap out of it, trying to stay awake, don't want to go to sleep, much-needed sleep once loved sleep once a very happy place, but not now.

Sleep is a place I dread, the land of sleep I used to yearn to visit is now a place Barron of happy emotions and memories, but in its place is a place of terror, unease, horror, sweats, tears and shaking to the bone. The things I see now in the land of slumber are no longer scenes of my incredibly beautiful children, skipping and laughing, but a place that can become murderous in the blink of an eye, I see things I would never want anybody walking this earth to see. Still, i fight to avoid sleep, my head turns from side to side, my mind is now playing tricks on me as i can hear screams coming from somewhere and yet here i am, surrounded by my loved ones and they hear nothing.

Then it comes, the arms of sleep that used to comfort me so much now grab at me and pull me down into an abyss of unspeakable horror which takes me down and own into a land of dread and fear, fearful of what lies ahead, and as my eyes close, my only wish is i survive it, and wake with little memory of it,

Dementia alongside other illnesses,Norrms,2019-01-05T10:57:18+0000,0,"Dementia alongside other illnesses

Unfortunately recently I have succumbed to the cold virus that seems to be gripping the Uk, add that do dementia and its a whole different ball game.

Its bad enough having hallucinations and seeing things that aren't there without having a high temperature, a banging headache and all noises being amplified even louder than normal. With dementia, all noises and visible actions can be distorted in the most horrible ways, they become louder and bigger, all around you sometimes seem to spin around so fast all you can hear are sounds you barely recognise,  you can't quite make out what you see. Add that to having the flu or a really bad cold and its a very heady mix.

Its hard enough for carers to figure out sometimes what's going on  (Or try to do)  or find out how the person with dementia is feeling at the best of times without the coughs and colds but for the person with dementia who probably has depression as well it sometimes feels like its the end of days. I am sorry, I know that sounds dramatic, but speaking personally when all these things are compounded into one it's the worst feeling in the world, you can see no way out of it, high temperature, hallucinations, coughing, feeling so rough, hearing things, seeing things  and still so confused at what's going on can bring even the strongest person to their knees.

I am not ashamed to say when i have been at my lowest i have begged for permanent sleep during these times, you can see no way out, you can't imagine what it feels like to feel better, or see any better days ahead and if you do? You still know that the cold/flu may go away but the dementia won't!!

I have not written this because i feel sorry for myself, but to hopefully help others to understand how people like myself feel when another illness kicks in so you can all be aware of it

Hope this helps

NO GREATER FEAR,Norrms,2018-12-19T09:40:24+0000,0,"NO GREATER FEAR 

Confusion ?? Or Desperation?

Two words that are not usually linked together, but just for a moment try and put yourself in my position.......

I have dementia, its terminal, there is no known cure at the moment and i never know from day to day / or night to night how it's going to be, Confusing ?? YES, Distressing ?? YES, 
feelings or desperation at my lowest times ?? H*LL YES! !! So? What is the known medication for this ???
I HAVE NO IDEA, answers on a postcard, please

This illness and its traits can drag you down to the deepest depths in seconds, it's like being two different people. One minute i am sitting laughing in the car, the next i am somewhere completely different, acting out different scenarios, living a different life with people i feel i have known all my life and have yet never met, THE NEXT?? I am back sat in the car wondering just what the heck had just happened? One minute i am sat at my computer celebrating great news and feedback from the MP3s, the next i feel as if i am falling and falling into an unknown abyss of emptiness and nothingness, so completely helpless to do anything about it and so upsetting to see those around me so upset as well as they watch me slowly fade away. 

And yet I am here, here now, breathing the same air, watching and listening to the same things you do, but with something anybody else finds it Impossible to see, because it is invisible, and that is Confusion and desperation that lives inside of people just like me with dementia. The FEAR WITHIN that eats away at our heart and soul, knowing all memories of loved ones, happiness, children etc may soon be lost

THERE IS NO GREATER FEAR THAN THE FEAR OF LOSING YOUR MIND 

And there is no Greater loss than losing it before your life expires

concerns from the another angle.,midgit,2018-08-13T05:40:02+0100,0,"Thanks for letting me join this site. I am viewing frontal lobe dementia from the angle of the ""patient"". I was diagnosed a couple of months ago. I waited a while for the information to sink in, then started to look for information so I could try to understand what is happening to me. There is a lot of confusing information out there. Reading the symptoms, it keeps saying that memory issues were rare until later in the illness, but that was my first issue(I had pneumonia a couple of years ago following a routine gallbladder operation and collapsed with shortness of breath and I was put in an induced coma for 2 weeks and from the moment I came round I had memory problems. I was 52 years old at the time) I noticed my memory issues, but nothing else. A few months later my husband told me that I was changing, personality wise. Apparently the kids were getting afraid of saying anything to me in case I take their heads off(not literally). I have talked things through with my husband and he has agreed to let me know when and how my behaviour changes, and obviously he has to tell me over and over until I manage to hold on to the information. I don't know if I have done the right thing by telling my doctor that I wanted to know my diagnosis-(there again, a diagnosis of dementia was about the last thing I expected to hear) and knowing that I have FTD and will ""lose my mind"" feels awful and putting my family has to watch me going through this terrible, terminal illness is so upsetting for me too, as my husband is only 52, and the kids are only 22 and 17. My son says the hardest thing is the knowing..that i'm going to die from this. sometimes I feel it would be better not to be aware of whats happening to me."
Dementia and the Christmas tree,Norrms,2018-12-03T11:09:45+0000,0,"Dementia And The
Christmas Tree
By Norrms McNamara
I am often asked “What, in layman’s terms, is Dementia?” and I often answer it this way, especially at this time of year.
If you can imagine a Christmas tree, absolutely dripping with lights that shine as bright as you have ever seen. Have you ever wondered of the beauty of it and how it shines those lights of hope all around the world?
Then, if you imagine that every one of those wonderful lights are your life’s memories which can be seen (remembered) at any time. Then all of a sudden, one by one, those lights go out. Slowly but surely they start to diminish until they are gone forever, never to return, all memories of loved ones, family and life’s experiences just disappear until the final one folds into darkness and we all know, unless they find a cure what this means.
This is how I explain, in Layman’s terms what Dementia is, BUT!! And as you know by now there is always a but with me LOL!!
If sometimes, you give that Christmas tree a bit of a nudge!! (And I do not in any way condone shaking anyone with Dementia!!LOL) but, if you include and Engage with people who have this awful disease, sometimes, just sometimes these wonderful lights come back on, if only for a second, a few minutes or permanently, it doesn’t matter, the point is they have come back on and that memory has returned, for no matter how long.
I hope this helps and will help people in the future to try and explain what Dementia is, especially around this time of year.
All my love, Norrms xxxx"
The Absence of time,Norrms,2018-12-04T11:37:25+0000,0,"The absence of time, dementia at its worst

As I sat there at my computer, mid-afternoon yesterday I thought "" Who was that? Where have I just been ? and why wasn't Elaine there?? I can remember walking down the road, seeing buildings, hearing sounds, but which buildings, which road, and why wasn't Elaine there? I have not been outside on my own for years because of my spatial awareness, why now? Have I only just back? did nobody miss me ????

My head was swimming with all these questions, how could I have possibly gone out by myself and why did I? I tried to remember all I could but the memory was starting to fade, but it was real!! it was as real as the day itself, it happened and yet I have no explanation of how? I checked my watch as if to expect it to say about an hour later but was only minutes from when I thought I had just checked it,

This has happened a couple of times lately but whilst I was sat in the armchair in the front room so I put it down to dozing and dreaming, but not this time, Oh no, not this time, this time I had experienced something very real (To me anyway) and it has shocked me to the core. knowing that I have no control over this is absolutely terrifying and has really only just confirmed what I have been thinking and dreading for weeks later, that I am getting worse.

Later I had this very conversation with Elaine and asked the question I always ask "" Am I getting Worse? and Elaine answered as she always does by saying 
""A little but we will cope""

Needless to say, a bad night ensued with all of its horrors, but as stated earlier, today is a new day with new challenges.

Much love to all

At the same time it also makes most of what's happened over the last few years suddenly seems to just click into place although it's only fairly recently that it's affected me more when going somewhere different, i.e. Supermarket. I can't read prices or even recognise the picture that shows you what it is! For a while I was ok at home,but not anymore. Just trying too type this causes my sight to merge into a blurry blob.
Know one seems to know much about it was only recognised in the eighties some think it's a sort of extra to the Alzheimer's,but truth be known they don't really have a clue.

Looking on the bright side I may continue to know exactly what is happening to me, just as I always have done and it's more likely that the end may be because of something like 
Pneumonia than the Alzheimer's! That possibility cheers me somewhat as I feared the effect of not knowing my family and friends would devastate them and cause much sadness.

It’s taken my brain weeks too sort out how it should look,but despite all odds it managed it, three cheers for my brain and it’s fight against PCA.
No telling how many other things I’m not seeing correctly! 
Accounts perhaps for how tired I have been for months.
It will seem such a a minor thing too many reading this, but it’s actually a rather big thing to those of us with PCA.

What of those left behind,Norrms,2018-11-29T15:22:47+0000,0,"WHAT OF THOSE LEFT BEHIND?

Yesterday I went to a funeral of a very dear and close friend, she had passed away from the very same condition (Dementia) i am dying from, sorry I but I cannot think of any other way of saying this. its a huge mixture of emotions and the decision to go is not taken lightly. It is taken on the day as it depends on how I am, how I feel and more importantly on what Elaine thinks and how she judges if I am up to it or not. To sit there, mourning at the loss of a close friend, AND knowing unless they come up with a cure, soon it will be myself lay there with my family around me is an ordeal to put it very very mildly.

So? Why Go? I hear some of you ask?

I don't go to all, as I have said it depends on the day, but the reason I go I think is because I want to look dementia in the face and show we will not be beaten!! I think I go because from being very young and playing many sports in my time I have always had a competitive streak that runs through my body and mind that says I WILL NOT BE BEATEN !! I want to show it there are so many of us SURVIVING and surviving for many years, far longer than me, until hopefully that all elusive cure will come one day soon.

I want to tell it at every funeral I go to that it will NEVER WIN !! And if it beats me, eventually, I want people to come to my funeral who have the same disease and tell it the VERY SAME !!!

Now little did I no most of my family and a few good friends thought that anyway.
So now I can realise the things that are going on by my family telling me I also realise that some of the family have been having a giggle at my expense, talking about me behind my back and when I asked why are you saying that they say it's just a laugh.
And when I ask  why? they say we're only playing.

Just
Lately


This is how my last few night`s have been.



                    “What’s that noise? I jump and look around, am I awake? My mind is racing at a million miles an hour, who`s that there in the corner? My Dad? It Can`t be! He is five years dead. “Where`s that music coming from? That was my old primary school Anthem (Forty years on growing older and older) I remember it well. “What’s that smell? I know it! It smells just like the old stream in Bluebell forest where I spent many a year as a lad, alone in my thoughts and my youth, escaping from all the badness at home, my own peaceful tranquil campsite. Who? I can hear a voice that sounds like Terry`s from number twenty one shouting me that the swing is fixed and I can hear the rope strain under his weight as he swings round in a half circle, over my head and over the stream.
Then it’s all gone and I am left alone in the darkness, my heart beating out of my chest, it sounds like an army of soldiers are marching across a gravel yard in my ears, so loud it hurts. A fear of the unknown spreads over me like a terrible rash as I try to separate reality from fantasy. A cry leaves my lips, I howl like a wounded dog!!!!!

As I open my eyes Elaine is beside me, stroking my hair and talking ever so gently to me. So it was all a dream? I say to Elaine. “Well, sort of, she replies softly, I’ve just found you in the kitchen and brought you back to bed where you will be safe. She gently wipes the cold sweat from my face and says shush now, close your eyes and think of something nice.
So I do, at times like this I always think about my children, and their happy faces and giggles. As I drift off to sleep at the ninth attempt because of “Jumping” the last thing that passes through my thoughts is that I know all this will never go away and we will have to probably go through it all again sometime this week.
And so is my life at the moment, dreading to sleep sometimes for fear of seeing and hearing from people long time gone. I’ve tried all the sleeping tablets and so forth. It’s just another one of Mr Alzheimer`s cruel games he plays on us to keep reminding me I have this awful disease.
Sometimes, just sometimes I wish he wouldn’t, as I can assure him I KNOW I have Alzheimer`s and don’t need reminding.

Things happening I don't remember,Rainey,2018-07-18T19:24:06+0100,0,"i was diagnosed with vascular dementia 2 years ago.  My problem for the last ? Months is that strange things happen, I must being doing them as I live alone but I have little or no recollection of doing them only the evidence.

EG: 2 mornings ago I went to take my usual tablets opened the plastic box they are in with the days on and it was full of cat food! Another time the cat food bowls were filled with dishwasher tablets, or the time when the shelf in the fridge was full of mugs of tea all neatly lined up.  This morning I woke up and every door and window in the bungalow was open.

This is to the point now that it's frightening, why can't I remember doing these things and how long before something really dangerous happens.  I don't remember getting out of bed in the night or anything."

i feel very sad for most of the people on here both people with dementia as in umbrella
oh its called tp i think
i have been diagnosed with alzheimers and vasculor type dementia it come a bit of a shock even tho i been havening memmory problems for a good few years but been getting worse through time
i was diagnosed at a memory clinic after the paper type test then sent for ecg and blood tests and mri scan
and it showed up which apparntly means 3 to 5 years and was put on mematine straight  away and then called back after a month to see how i was doing then increased to 10mg and then after a nother month another check up on me to see me again now told it be six months my doctors were informed but nevercontacted me lol but the council have a nice lady on their alzheimers team who has been helping me 
trying now to get blue badge for me
my late mother bless her had alziemers and parkinsons and my gran had it too and my mums cousin
so i am asking it is heredity
and i also see many people in same vote here trying to get a diagnosis then no support  and others being told one thing and not the help they wanted or needed
where would this country be if it wasnt for our army of carers who dedicate their lives to helping family friends and people who need help when social care does not step up to the mark

I’m not sure how many of you are aware of this magazine? I have found it really interesting & inspiring
In fact I’ve signed up for the Memory Walk in September & I’ve read a few of the books that it mentions in there.
I thought I’d spread the word it’s worth a read."
Diagnosed with vascular dementia 3 1/2  years ago,minky93,2018-07-11T15:12:46+0100,0,"Hi! everyone 
I had a TIA & had a cat scan which showed I did have a full stroke previously, I started having memory problems & the Stroke Consultant ordered an MRI scan which showed Vascular Dementia due to a stroke & several mini strokes which was my worst fear & unexpected I don’t remember much of the conversation apart from the dreaded word Dementia & being given a box of tissues by the doctor.
He sent me to the memory clinic for tests the result was mild cognitive impairment secondary to vascular dementia.
I have been relatively stable since & don’t appear to have gotten any worse. My question is can anybody give me an idea of when I will get worse, or will I remain pretty much the same for a long time, it’s been over three years since my diagnosis.
On another point I did tell them at the memory clinic that as soon as my faculties start to deteriorate I would end my life, which I will, as I cannot bear the thought of being so useless.

Kind Regards

WHEN DO I GET MY RESPITE,Norrms,2018-08-03T09:10:32+0100,0,"When do I get

MY RESPITE ?

When I was a boy used to take myself off, up Belmont road in Bolton, towards Bolton moors, passed the Wilton arms, turn left a bit farther on , up the hill across Scout road, and just sit there for hours, in a place I always thought was the TOP of the WORLD. Then it was down Smithills brew, Halliwell road, down through the “MOP “, through the cemetery and home to the street where I lived (Eden Street) I know most of you will have no idea where this is but my friends and family in Bolton will know exactly where I mean. I wasn’t a loner, I had lots of friends, but I did like ME TIME as they call it these days.

Fast forward 50 years and what now? My beautiful darling wife is “Allocated “ so many hours a week respite because of my dementia and spends time just chilling and walking, and it does her so much good and I wouldn’t change a thing about it, I only wish she could have more, but if I say “What about me? Does that sound selfish?? I hope not, because it’s not meant to do, but I have gone from being a fiercely independent person, to someone who has now been chaperoned 24 hours a day for the last few years.

IMAGINE THAT??

I have not even been able to walk to the shop for a paper, or sit on a bench and read it, or even POP to the post office or shops let alone go for a walk over ANY MOORS FOR YEARS!! Always there is someone at my side, if not my wonderful Elaine, then a member of my family, or my great carer peter, but never ever alone, never alone with my thoughts, to ponder the what if`s, or to try and recall memories gone by. I have no road sense that part of my memory has gone forever apparently, I will cross a road without thinking, and when it comes to MAN vs BUS or CAR? Man will never win !!!

Oh how I long for some ALONE TIME, just me, the open moors and nobody watching my every move, holding my hand, watching me across the road. To walk into a pub, recognise nobody and sit with a pint and a paper is now my idea of heaven, even though it would be a pint of diet coke these days!!!! I dream of those days I was independent, of those days where I could catch a bus on my own and have a coffee in town, but, as I said, this is not all about me either.

There are 1,000s of carers in the same boat who get no respite, no alone time, no me time!!! They are not ill or have this awful disease thankfully, THEY are able-bodied and STILL can’t get their independence back through no fault of their own, what about THEM AS WELL?

When we talk about this disease and how it touches EVERYBODY around them, we really mean everybody. It has so much more far-reaching consequences that anybody could ever imagine or understand and that is why we much continue to do what we do, that is why we must never give up, and that is why we must continue to educate as many as possible, both those with this disease and those around them

Feeling Detached



I know this sound strange to some, but sometimes I feel detached from myself? I will try my best to explain, hope I can.

Just lately, as well as “going off into my own” world as some call it, where I look like I am in a trance, I feel as if I am not me?? It’s as if I am looking at myself from about as foot away. It’s like there is me, then there is the other me, which is not good, because the other me sees things and hears things. The other me dips into depression in a moment’s notice and without warning. A dark cloud arrives and thoughts of being so unwell makes me lose all confidence in what I am doing at that moment, self-doubt reigns and fear enters my mind and body.



I find myself looking around as if searching for the real me, the real me that stands up every Saturday at the front of the memory café and sings and  tells jokes, the real me that sits and plays with the grandchildren, laughs and giggles at daft things, you know, the OLD ME!!  But!! If that’s true, then I must now be the new me, and that’s petrifying, absolutely terrifying, because I don’t want to be a NEW ME.

I am more than happy with the old me thank you very much, but dementia doesn’t see me like that. It just sees me as someone else it can manipulate, creep up on, steal all self-worth from and completely take over, Dementia is a CONTROL FREAK that’s for sure!!!

Then, suddenly, I am back to my old self again,, but for how long ?  The clouds have lifted, the darkness in my mind is slowly disappearing and the smiles are coming back on my face. I can’t control this and I have missed several appointments and a couple of memory cafes because if it, and yet? And yet, dementia always seems to pick the worst possible time for me to start to drag me down again and take me to the depths of despair and into DEMENTIALAND.

I am grateful for the happy times and the peaceful times I have, but I am also very mindful that the times where I am the “NEW ME” and not the old me are more frequent these days. I also HATE the NEW ME !!

The future ?? No one knows and as Elaine has always said, we will take one day at a time,

Hope at least some of this makes sense and please share if you wish

2018 and this still happens,Norrms,2018-06-26T15:47:09+0100,0,"Imagine this.....

You visit a local cafe/ farm, you have been there many times before and you know the disabled toilets are on the same level of the cafe but the usual ones are down a flight of stairs. A sign says ""Ask the staff for a key""
You do, and they say the toilets are downstairs, you explain very quickly that its the disabled Toilet key you need and then it happens ......

What Happens?? THIS....................

That moment's hesitation by a staff member (who by the looks of her jacket Was in charge) when they look at you as if deciding themselves IF YOU LOOK disabled OR not !!

The moment passes and they THANKFULLY give you the key, but it doesn't matter, its happened, and it spoils the time you are there whilst you're having a coffee. You then find out its not you being paranoid as when you mention it to your wife she felt the same and said "" I was just WAITING FOR IT!! GOOD JOB she changed her mind in that split second or I would have let her know exactly WHAT I THOUGHT !!

The Purple Angel dementia awareness campaign is so very proud to say we have designed an MP3 player for our Brave little hero Frazor Wilton aged FIVE who has Battens disease, or Infantile dementia as its known. It will be hopefully ready next week to give to Frazor and his family and will hopefully improve his life as the disease progresses. 

We are designing them for older adults with the disease and thought why can't this help FRAZOR as well? So we have uploaded some of his favourite songs and tunes from Children's TV for him to listen to and enjoy.

When i say we i really mean Mandie Giles who is a purple Angel Ambassador and her fantastic teccy Hubby Nathan.

Its such an honour to work with these people and also help such a lovely family like Dave Wilton and Amy L Wilton and of course Brave little Frazor

Will keep you all posted i am sure xxxxxxxxxxxxx

So proud,Norrms,2018-06-16T11:32:24+0100,0,"SO VERY PROUD
YET
SO VERY TIRED


The man with dementia loves his wife dearly, he is so very proud of her “I want to be with my wife!! Where is she?? he insists, many times over
The carer at the day centre puts her hand on his and says she’s just popped out and will be back soon.
Here she is! Says the man, rushing to her side as she walks in “where have you been? He bellows.
His wife looks exhausted as she walks in, holds him by the hand and says “Just been out, I’m here now dear. The two-hour respite has gone in the blink of an eye, the memories of having a coffee and just doing nothing quickly fading.
They walk out, the man no more than 6 inches from her side, talking excitedly but not really making any sense. How I long for a good conversation with him she thinks, how I wish it was like it used to be!
He steps into the road without a care; a car misses him by inches!! His wife tugs at his hand to pull him back, but he is SO PROUD and shouts “I am not a child!! I don’t need to be helped across the road; totally oblivious to the danger he has just put himself in.
Once home, the husband is that proud of his wife he feels the need to follow her every time she gets up from the chair, goes to the bathroom or the kitchen.
His wife locks herself in the bathroom sometimes and weeps, he knocks on the bathroom door and asks “Are you OK? She answers YES and weeps some more
Night falls and he doesn’t recognise her anymore, he asks WHO ARE YOU? Where is my wife?? The wife he is so very proud of, the wife who has looked after him for years and years.
She stands in front of him, yet he doesn’t see her as his wife as he is looking for a much younger person when they first met. She looks at his demanding eyes, the very same ones that used to look on her lovely and tenderly, she has no answer, she has answered all these questions before but to no avail.
Blessed sleep comes eventually but not for long as he is up, shouting, fighting, banging on doors.
She has long since stopped worrying about what the neighbours think and for the eighth time, that night guides him back to bed.
The dawn arrives, she wakes first, and knowing today will be probably the same as yesterday, and the day before and the MONTHS before that.
Again she weeps, but silently, not wanting to wake him, he looks so very peaceful asleep, she still loves him deeply.
He wakes, he shouts WHERE ARE YOU?
And so it begins again
He is SO VERY PROUD
She is SO VERY TIRED

"ONE OF ""THOSE "" TALKS",Norrms,2018-06-08T09:33:19+0100,0,"ONE OF THOSE “TALKS”

This resulted in the best Advice I have ever heard


“””Please sit down with me a minute, I asked Elaine, I need to talk to you about something”””
The last few weeks, “I Explained” I have been feeling unwell in myself and not quite myself. I feel as if anytime I say something I am not making sense, after I have said something, either it makes no sense to me so it becomes all jumbled up or I find myself asking who I am talking to
“Does that make sense?
I seem to be blurting out things I wouldn’t normally say and acting out of character.
Now don’t get me wrong, (I went on to say) I act daft sometimes, I like acting daft and having a laugh, it’s the only way I can deal with this awful illness sometimes, but I have noticed lately that sometimes I have just been plain silly, and yet you have never said anything, my friends or family have never said “Norrms?? This is not like you, so I am having trouble understanding if I am just being me, or you're all too polite to say something.
This is HOW Elaine replied, I will “hopefully “ never forget this and
I HOPE YOU wWON`Tt TOO…..
Norrms (Elaine replied) why would we tell you when you’re being silly? Why would I, your family or your friends tell you when you’re like this
WHY SHOULD WE MAKE A BIG THING OUT OF IT??
Why should we? Things are bad enough for you living with this awful disease, you have coped well in the last nine years and if this means things are getting a little worse why oh why would we remind you of this? That would be cruel and hurtful.
I, your family and your friends would never ever do this, you are who you are, you will be, who you will be and if there are a few things done and said out of the ordinary we KNOW it’s the Illness and not the real YOU that’s making this happen. We don’t mention it because we love you and know its all part of the illness.
(At this point we hugged and cried, and then hugged some more)
~
It wasn’t until what Elaine had just said sank in, that I found the strength to write about this, because if we ALL did this, and ALL people were more tolerant and less judgemental, if more people realised that it’s the disease that makes things happen that are uncomfortable to all around and not the REAL person, there would be so much more understanding about dementia.
I hope you don’t mind me sharing this with you all and I hope you share it with others
best wishes
Norrms and a very understanding family (And friends)"
"I HAVE TO FIGHT THIS, DONT I ??",Norrms,2018-05-26T15:47:43+0100,0,"I HAVE TO FIGHT THIS ILLNESS, DONT I ??


I was asked a question a couple of days ago which was................................

""Do you ever get used to having dementia and bad days and nights?

I replied, very politely, I may add, 

""Would you ever get used to having Cancer and feeling petrified of what the future holds, twenty fours hours a day?""

They shook their head and said no, realising what a daft question it was, but I said, please don't worry about asking, because what probably seemed like a normal question to them just sounded utterly ridiculous to me. Sometimes we can be quick to judge and unless your in this position its hard sometimes to understand.

The one thing that always gets me is when people say a relative or someone they know  has a

 ""Touch of dementia"" 

I always ask...............

""is this the same as being a     """" TOUCH PREGNANT ????

GRRR gets me every time

But of course I do sit and think, I think about what I can remember and worry about what I cant, I sit and remember little bits about my night terrors and hallucinations. I cannot always remember them, only sometimes. And sometimes those I cant come thundering back as flashbacks at any time during the day which makes me scream and jump. That's when I get the weird looks, nods and winks because I have just frightened the life out of them for screaming (THEY THINK) for no reason.

But mostly I sit and think what happens when all this stops?? I don't mean when i die, but when i cannot remember anything that happens, day or night? Some may see it as a blessing as the hallucinations i have are a million times worse than any horror film you have ever seen and the night terrors even worse if that's possible, but what happens when that stops????

Such an unnerving question with no real answer, and the more i do think about it the more i worry as i cannot help feeling i am about to be lost in this field of nothingness where nothing makes sense, nothing will matter and i will end up being just like an empyty floating vessel with no purpose and no outcomes apart from one, and that sound like it may well be a blessed release compared to floating in nothingness.

So, for the moment I will carry on challenging this disease, fighting it with every fibre of my body and mind, I will try and chase away the night terrors, shout at the hallucinations and be at WAR with Dementia until there is a victor, be it me or Dementia itself

What else can I do?
I know of no other way?

I HAVE TO FIGHT

I JUST HAVE TO !!

Darkest Of nights,Norrms,2018-04-25T10:20:48+0100,0,"The Darkest of Nights

(Discretion advised on this one, my dear friends)

I think we all fear at one time or another that when we go to bed we will never wake up. A startling statement I know, but last night I had one of my darkest nights ever and they do seem to be getting worse. I am not talking about having hallucination`s last night, or nightmares, but NIGHT TERRORS, and even worse one continuing night terror that went on for what seemed like hours. The person who said dreams last mere seconds is HUGELY MISTAKEN in my eyes because he / she doesn't see what I see!!
My night terror last night started with me being alone in a room with screaming coming from all sides. My best friend then walked in (he has long since passed) only to be followed by a huge dark Character wielding a long knife who started to attack him in the most grotesque way (I will leave the details out) I tried to stop him but it was far too late as I could see .then he turned on me attacking me again and again, i could see the damage he was doing but felt no pain, but the scene in front of my eyes was as bad as it gets.
I crawled out the door only to find I was stood on a market covered in blood and I was looking for someone I had lost, someone very close to me and dear but couldn't quite make out who it was. A work colleague from a different lifetime appeared at my side started to punch the wall before turning on me, the only way I could stop him was to grab him by the throat and hold him on the ground. So many hands were punching me now from above, grabbing me, pinching me, and their feet rained in hundreds of kicks, I was screaming for help but nobody came.
This and much worse happened next and I don't really want to give you all nightmares but this is just a small snapshot of my night terrors. Sometimes I am up and out of bed for hours before I come on the computer. Some have said I am (LUCKY) as some cannot function at all after having such bad nights, I say to them please don't use the word LUCKY as its so inappropriate to whats going on. fact is, some people are either farther down the road with this disease or have a different strain and yet the same type of dementia, please believe me when I say at NO TIME do I feel ""LUCKY"" at any time.
Yes I have taken all medication to stop these and yes I know all about the herbal side of it, but NOTHING STOPS them, how can they ?? how can they possibly invent a tablet that stops you dreaming ????? Answers on a very big postcard please.. The worrying thing was I used to wake up many times a night having different ones but lately, I seem to be ""locked In"" a night terror which seems to go on and on.
Do I fear one day I will not wake up? I have to say that sometimes i think that death would be a blessing compared to this, but my biggest fear ????
Is one long continuous night terror when AND IF dementia finally wins the fight and takes over my mind.
Still, I am here TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY

Alzheimer’s and PCA,Jeanie 73,2018-04-04T19:35:00+0100,0,"its very difficult trying to describe how it affects your sight, but today I came across this, that best describes what happens to my sight when I go somewhere I have not been to for some time or totally new.





 https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1954887231439765
			




Hope this may help someone or their carers understand more❤️

I do go on a forum for PCA that only has a bit over 1,000 people on it even though it goes world wide. My own Memory clinic had not heard of it with the exception of one consultant, but after learning more about it agreed that I have it.
Despite the brains effect on the my sight it is not all bad, I have retained much of my brain function so far re memory, but still have bad days when can’t remember what I was going to say etc, but again I am lucky too have an Optician who knows of PCA and for a while can adjust my glasses too help me.
It obviously has more of an adverse affect on someone younger❤️
PS when I go in an unfamiliar supermarket it makes it impossible to read a products price or any information on it, even a picture of it is impossible for me too understand what it is."

I do know it’s inevitable towards the end, but does this mean I am perhaps closer to the end?

I have just got this and of course, I also said YES!!

Dear Norman
I have been asked to contact you by Mr (deleted) (Headteacher) to arrange for you to come and give an assembly at our school to help raise awareness of dementia. I was hoping to invite parents, either to the same assembly or to a separate meeting afterward, so that they can hear the same message as their children. Would you be happy for this?

We have whole school assemblies (approximately 700 children) each morning at 9am and Mr (Deleted) wondered if you would be free to come and lead one on either in May 2018 or October 2018. These dates have been chosen as they are the last few days before a holiday and Mr (deleted) proposes to allow the children to pay a donation to wear their own clothes on the following Friday.
I hope the above makes sense. If you would like to discuss it further, or you wish for any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me either by email or if you would prefer by telephone on the school number which is (deleted)
.
I look forward to hearing from you in due course.
Many thanks

"Strange but this has to happen to me, what may  ask?",oldman1952,2018-03-28T22:41:01+0100,0,"Hello everyone, I have not been on for a while but have been battling with Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia. For how long I do not know but was diagnosed in September last year, after completing an Ace111 Adenbrooks scale and I scored 71. This was after seeing the consultant older persons psychiatrist and it was one of the diagnoses he thought I could have. Every thing went quite quick from there, after a year of waiting!!!

I have been seen by a link nurse from the society every 6 weeks to help my wife and I get things like finances in order. She is like a breath of fresh air. Any one who knows me will also know that I write quite long posts to help with others who have problems with their health. It is me this time because I was just doing a little research and I am going to have to see the consultant when I come back off my holiday because I am being treated for FLD but I also have all the symptoms of Motor Neurone Disease. So I go to bed stiff all over from my very weak and sore neck to the tip of my toes. Then wake up in the morning after a night of facilitations or that my back muscles vibrate as if I am rolling around on a great big roll of open bubble rap. Every thing has a different feeling from an ache to cramp to sharp shooting pains moving down the spine to the hips and they give way as if I do not have any muscles there at all.

All I want to know is the prognosis of both, because I know what it is for the first problem but the second problem also has a poor prognosis. They also quite often go together, FLD first then MND or the other way round.

So my wise and wonderful friends, can you give me a time limit or any advice on how long I might have. Because I now for the past 8 weeks have just felt grotty. However I have enough medication to sink a battle ship. I also query if there is anybody else out there with the same conditions. Plus the Dysphagia which is getting worse.. Thank you every on and hope you can understand the reasons I am asking some rather brash questions. Best regards Oldman1952 ."
Developing an increasingly warped sense of humour,Countryboy,2018-03-28T09:56:43+0100,0,"By Madlen Davies
Published: 10:52, 10 November 2015 | Updated: 06:10, 11 November 2015
Developing an increasingly warped sense of humour could be an early warning sign of impending dementia, researchers have found. 
The families of patients with frontotemporal dementia, a rare type of the disease, noticed relatives had developed an appreciation for 'darker' jokes in the years before they were diagnosed. 
This included being amused by events others would not find funny, such as a badly parked car or a barking dog, and laughing inappropriately at tragic events. 
Experts say more studies are now needed to understand how and when changes in humour could be an impending sign of dementia. 

well I have FTD  and I think Madlen is spot on,   

A couple in their nineties are both having problems remembering things. During a checkup, the doctor tells them that they’re physically okay, but they might want to start writing things down to help them remember.
Later that night, while watching TV, the old man gets up from his chair.
“Want anything while I’m in the kitchen?” he asks.
“Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?”    “Sure.”
“Don’t you think you should write it down so you can remember it?” she asks. “No, I can remember it.”
“Well, I’d like some strawberries on top, too. Maybe you should write it down, so’s not to forget it?”
He says, “I can remember that. You want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries.”
“I’d also like whipped cream. I’m certain you’ll forget that, write it down?” she asks.
Irritated, he says, “I don’t need to write it down, I can remember it!
Ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream – I got it, for goodness sake!”
Then he toddles into the kitchen.
After about 20 minutes, the old man returns from the kitchen and hands his wife a plate of bacon and eggs.
She stares at the plate for a moment. “Where’s my toast?”

But no so very different as you may think,
I was also shouted at, loved, scolded and sent to bed early,
Our fashions were different,
But so many things we wore then, you are wearing now!
So very funny,
Our music was definitely different,
But that doesn't mean I don't love today's music,
Ask me, you would be very surprised!
So what changed?
I got old, that's what!
I also become a little forgetful,
But not as much as you think
So come on, ask me what happened when I was a teenager,
Who my first love was,
The names of my children,
You see, we are not THAT different at all, are WE??

Joke,Countryboy,2018-02-24T15:28:37+0000,0,Hi Guys can someone tell me where the ******* joke section is on the site
Read of the reality when I’m Sundowning,Barry,2013-02-18T00:21:52+0000,0,"“How Sundowning affects me”​
Some time ago on Talking Point I was asked the following question and I quote:

(Barry could you explain how you feel whilst Sundowning, does anything trigger it or does it just happen like clockwork?) 

Well as there are now so many ‘New Members’ I thought it might be a good idea to post the thread again for easier reading rather than searching as sometimes new comers want answers immediately…  


The easy answer would have been to just to say yes (It happens like clockwork) but I think the subject is far more complex than that as it seems that Sundowning as it’s called can affect people with our illness at different times of the day, “in fact” a similar thing can also happen at the beginning of the day when the sun is rising, although the latter part of the day when the sun is setting seems to be the most significant time...

One thing I should explain is that here in Indonesia and some other parts of ‘Asia Sun Rise and Sunset’ occurs at about the same time everyday of the year, by 6am its broad daylight and by 6pm it’s getting dark unlike European countries when during the summer you have extended hours of sunlight from 4am-9pm which in itself could have some significance as to when a person starts to feel the effects of Sundowning?

But how does it make me feel: I think the best way I could describe it is to say that it causes a similar feeling that I can still remember after having had a nervous breakdown some years ago that at the time resulted in extremely deep depression.

For me it normally starts at around 3-4pm when I start to feel very lethargic and just seem to be wandering around the house utterly lost in my own world mumbling to myself or sitting in a chair drifting into daydreams (in fact my dear wife Sumi says she can now tell what time of day it is without looking at the clock) I fell as though the end of day is trying to drain every last bit of energy out of my body, all my limbs become extremely weak and I find it very difficult even to go for our walk but still go in a effort to ward off the Sundowning effect, I can become incredibly short tempered and loose all sense of rationality and sometimes become verbally aggressive and argumentative, you feel as though the whole world is against you and that whatever you say or do is wrong so I don’t like to be posed any questions at this time of day not even (what do you want for dinner) and I certainly don’t like to have any visitors at this time not unless they want their heads bitten off as my mind is at a total loss of any comprehension, all I want is to have my dear wife by my side but she now realizes that it’s best to talk to me very soothingly and I’m sure that she now just agrees with everything I say in an effort to keep me calm and also makes sure the house is kept peaceful without any excessive noise to further confuse my mind (Bless her as she has so much patients with me) as I start to feel as though I have the whole weight of the world’s problems upon my shoulders and everything becomes a effort so much so that my wife now has to help me bathe and get dressed as I’m so agitated and shaky...

So there is nothing that actually triggers the Sundowning apart from the setting of the sun as it descends towards the horizon which makes it feel as though its automatically starting by itself, but if it’s not handled with sensitivity then there could be untoward repercussions, also I should add that not everyday is the same as some can be worse than others and sometimes I can go for a few days without feeling any effects of Sundowning and the other strange thing is that even the weather conditions at the end of day can have some influence if its overcast I feel much better and responsive but if it’s a strong bright crimson sunset that we get out here then the draining affect starts much quicker, in fact, I get much the same affect when I go into a shop that has to brighter a neon, or flashing lighting...

“Now read of the reality when I’m Sundowning”​
This is written on actuality not supposition from when my dear wife Sumi and I went for our end of day walk it’s not just a one off situation or sensation for me it’s more of an occurrence day after day that totally shatters me!         

It was just 4-30pm as the sun starts descending over the horizon when lethargy takes a grasp of me and the Sundowning affect ‘tolls the knell of my end of day’ so I’m writing this down trying to express the depths of my ‘true inner feelings’ at that exact moment in time...
My whole body aches as the muscles try to maintain some equilibrium, and as we go for our walk every faltering step I take being like that of wearing shoes made from concrete that’s slowly setting and intensifying in weight, which makes me weigh heavily on my walking stick and Sumi’s arm otherwise I feel I could just pass out from utter exhaustion as my mind is consumed in a dense obscure cloud of disorientation and bewilderment, my limbs are trembling so much I don’t know what to do with them to ease the tremor… my vision has become blurred as my eyes feel heavy wanting to sleep and escape from the sun’s setting draining sensation, so Sumi tries talking to me to take my mind of the horizon as my eyes have become mesmerized following the sun’s descent and harsh rays… but I can’t comprehend what she’s saying, I try to reply but any form of words and speech are held tight within me so all I do is mumble something incoherent which then makes me frustrated and I become really irritated and tetchy with her, the slightest little noise is more like thunderbolts slamming into my ears and making me very anxious and extremely jumpy...
The further the sun sinks away… the further I go into despair of doom and gloom… and sometimes it gets me to the point of saying to Sumi: (I’ve had enough of this, maybe it would be better if it all ended now, and I did not wake up again) as I can almost sense death waiting round the corner taunting me when in this daily living hell of Sundowning, I can see the tears glistening and running down her cheeks as she holds on more tightly to me saying ‘please don’t speak like that’ but I seem to be oblivious to her own anguish as my whole being is so distraught by the time of day that I just want it to come to an end... 
As I said those where my exact feelings made from notes one evening, but as I type them out the next morning I had little recollection of that moment in time… it’s as if it never existed… as this morning I feel a completely different person still full of determination and the spirit of fighting this terrible illness, but when Sundowning strikes it takes us into a completely different world of anxiety within dementia...
I will be very interested to know what others people’s observations are with Sundowning as it’s another part of the illness that doesn’t affect us all in the same way.

Please feel free to copy this to your friends or on your own Blog sites as it might help other people to better understand how Sundowning can affect a person who has any type of dementia...

So i was a nurse and got diagnosed 2year with altzheimers,had a PET scan and said i had dementia.
Work finished me , i have now learned to try and live with it.
Hubby left me and son came to live with me and sold his house.
I have yearly memory tests, had appointment last week. Received letter today to say i performed better in this test compared to when last seen.
On most of these test as she wanted a answer i just guessed.
The consultant said it would be helpful to repeat the brain scan.

Do you think this is normal as i always thought it got worse not better. ??
Do you think i may have been misdiagnosed ??
What is he expecting the scan to show ??,is it normal to have another scan.
Sorry for so many questions, but my life nearly ended with this diagnoses and i have lost my career,hubby and much more."
Purple Angel memory cafes How do they work ??,Norrms,2018-02-11T11:39:33+0000,0,"HOW PURPLE ANGEL MEMORY CAFE IS RUN (for reference, please feel free to copy but most of all HAVE FUN !!)

Volunteers for the cafe? , no need for professionals but always helpful if you have one or two, otherwise better to have those who have worked as carers, are carers or have some connection with dementia
The two words we cherish most is INCLUSION and ENGAGEMENT so with that said a MUST is to have a volunteer on EACH TABLE at all times (Apart from when serving tea and coffee) This inclusion with them, chatting to them, reassuring them and answering their questions is so very important to make them feel comfortable

ALWAYS REMEMBER ITS THEIR CAFE !! NOT YOURS, you are just the facilitators (ask all every four weeks what THEY would like to do at cafe)

TIMES of cafe ""EVERY WEEK""

,( once a month for people with dementia to remember is far too long, )

On Entrance meet, greet, take names of both PWD and carers (Health and safety must be a priority)

1.30pm till 3.30pm (Music must be playing in background all the time, 50s and 60s please and keep the war songs for remembrance day
1. Tables are set out like a cafe and NEVER like a care home all in a circle.
2. Tables are dressed with cloths, dried flowers, Biscuits, books from yesteryear, magazines etc, gives them something to do whilst waiting to start
3. A 20 Question single answer quiz is placed on each table (1 between two people) so they can do this as well and answers are given out at near end of cafe
(We once forgot to do this and we were nearly lynched lol )
4. On arrival tea and coffee is given out (free)
Cafe opens at 1.30pm then this is our agenda which is written on a whiteboard for all to see so they know whats happening that day (Always day and date the whiteboard each week as well so all can see)
1.50pm Welcome all and any updates
2pm NINE LETTER WORD please see link
http://nineletterword.tompaton.com/amscagnip/
This is where you ask all those with dementia to shout out words of three letters or more made up from nine letters but they HAVE To have designated letter IE A in each word (Please see link)
Please be aware of carers, loved ones shouting for them, it happens more than you may think, we allow some to keep it flowing, but not all
2.15 Either, (just a few suggestions)
CRAFTS or
CAKE DECORATING or
GAMES DAY
IE Dominoes, Connect Four (Always popular we have five sets lol) old-fashioned wooden bagatelles, snakes and ladders puzzles to put together (but not jigsaws, take too long) ect
or
Team games of
Play your cards right, or
Balloon Tennis or
Ten items on a board,m try to remember as many as possible
or
Famous faces, picture quiz where they have to figure out who they are, TOP TIP< always good to throw an old photo in there of two members / Volunteers gets em every time lol
or
Aroma pots where they have to guess the different Aromas
Flower arranging (Contact local florists, usually accommodating)
2.45pm TEA COFFEE AND HOME MADE CAKES
3pm Answer to a table quiz
3.05 till 3.30om
A good old sing song with song sheets is a must, or you can ask local singers to come and do a TURN LOL
we always finish off with a sing-song as its proved to light up all the electrolights in the brain and sends them home happy.
3.30pm Always have someone stood at the door to say goodbye, wish them well and to say see you next week, so important.
My dear friends, i hope this helps and if anybody wants to know any more, please just ask and let's fill the world with PURPLE ANGEL MEMORY CAFES xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

I have had to stop driving after telling my doctor I was pulling in behind cars which were parked thinking they were at traffic lights further down the road. my husband was anxious by this time so I went to the optitions who have now referred me to the eye clinic because I have more double vision. so the doctor has said not to drive. that appointment is not till February 2018. another thing I did yesterday and similar a while ago was I was lighting the log fire with a fire lighter and could not work out how to hold it, I knew what to do to light it. ..........there are more things that have happened !!!.........I do have other medial problems, fibromyalgia and atrial fibrillation  which i have 50% chance of a stroke) and osteoarthritis and depression. I know they are looking to check if my meds are causing my symptoms but I know deep down the things I have been doing are new, the last 12 months when I have had tablets and medical symptoms for a number of years now. I know I am not reacting and doing things as I have done for years...............................I am worried they will find some kind of dementia, (I have read so much about the different ones). if they don't then its a blessing that I am clear of it and am more aware of this awful illness people, friends and families have to contend with. I know i will then have to work with the doctors to change my meds to help what is going on with me. if I am I feel sure they will tell me I am in early stages and that it is due to my illnesses and medication. ..............................I just wanted to share this with someone who understands how I may be feeling before the diagnosis. thank you for reading."
Concrete Overcoat (Depression),Norrms,2018-01-23T15:46:15+0000,0,"When the concrete overcoat arrives,
No matter how well you think you are doing or how well you think things are going when the concrete overcoat (Depression) as I call it arrives it gives no warning. The Closest I can explain is like someone putting a coat on for you extremely slowly and the coat weighs 800lbs at least!!
It drapes over your shoulders, creeping slowly, covering your arms until you have no energy to lift. Your neck feels weighed down, your back aches, you cannot stop looking at the floor as if someone is pushing you ever closer to the ground. Your breath is labored and you have absolutely no interest in anything. The intensity can differ as can the length it decides to stay with you.
I sometimes think "" As if I haven't enough to put up with""
I sometimes think
"" I have been ill for so very long now, how much longer dear GOD!! ""
But when It arrives, it arrives, from who knows where? The deepest crevice of your brain? Your inner fears? Or a brand new awful memory which has tipped you over the edge? No one knows, but believe me it's real, it's very real and when it leaves, only IT decodes, not you!!!
Does dementia also walk hand in hand with depression? Sadly, in my humble opinion yes. How can you sit there, be told you have a terminal disease, be told that the chances are you will forget your family, your loved ones and all you have ever known and NOT become depressed?
So Sad xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
I can not stop crying!!!,NotTooLate,2018-01-23T12:05:41+0000,0,"I have never been what you would call a sensertive or showed my feelings, but now I can not hold back the tears. I think of my son or daugther and I well up and the pain inside is so much to bear. News and even adverts on telly send me in to floods of tears. I can not stop it. I am so desperate to see someone to talk about it. I feel so lost. The Birmingham Healthy Minds said could not help because I am being looked after by Juniper Centre in Birmingham. I will have to get my son to ask to see someone.

The tears and pain and just to much!!!"
I am me today,NotTooLate,2018-01-13T12:40:47+0000,0,"Today is a good day. I am me, the old me and I realise that there is tow of me. I seem to be going from a person I remember and know, to someone I do not.

On my good times I worry about the times that I am going to be bad. It is horrible as I hope so much that it has gone, but I so dread changing and becoming something I do not no.

When I am bad, or different I do not think I worry as much about it. It is strange. The bad days seem to be a mix of all sorts of things. Mainly not being in control of my day and life. Lots of empty spaces. I watch telly but miss a lot of it. seems like I am thinking of something else and then wake up and start watching again. but I am not alseep if you know what I mean. like day dreaming.

This is the days I get frustrated. Hard to keep going, thinking about what I am doing, what has happened. I am at a point were I am not sure if I have done it, or said it and this drives me angry with myself and often other. I just get frustrated. Some times my day goes by and I do not see it. This is not bad. I wonder if this time of being unaware will get to be my everyday!?  What is frustrating is do I no those times that I can not remember, or is it those times that I am as if I am asleep, like in a dream!?

On my good times I like to plan and think of what I am going to do next, tomorrow and look forward. My bad days, it is the other me just watching time go by without knowing it. 

I do not like this other me and do not want him to become the me everyday!

Does anyone else feel like this, like you are split between two people?"

Sundowning,Norrms,2018-01-18T10:37:54+0000,0,"DEMENTIA, SUNDOWNING RAW AND UNFORGIVING
I wish the darkness would never come,
I wish the day would stay forever light,
I sit and dread the time as it passes,
Sat in my chair I watch the clock,
Tick tock tick tock,
The evening creeps ever closer,
My mind becomes muddled and distant,
I feel myself slipping into the abyss of what?
Of madness ? of delirium? Who knows?
Will we ever know?????
I lose half of my days sometimes,
Hours and hours I cant remember,
And that I will never get back
All my evening memories GONE forever
How much is that out of my life?
It's now 4.29pm, how much longer?
How much longer before I forget,
Where I live, my wife
My family, what I had for lunch
DEAR GOD !! HOW MUCH LONGER ??
4.41pm, Still here, still sat in my chair,
Or Am I? Or do I imagine even this?
Some say it the environment I live in?
But I live at home, with my Angel,
She looks after me, all my family do
It's lovely where we live,
Apart from my dementia I am so happy
So how can it be?
So sorry, got to go, i think?   .........................................................

Is it worth me learning something new?,NotTooLate,2018-01-13T12:47:23+0000,0,"Today is a good day and I want to do lots. I have lots of ideas. I would like to learn to make an app. I have been looking on Apple site and get keen. I think I coudl do this now, but it is that time when i not feeling up to it. 

I read book, The Alzheimer's Solution, a very good book, and this suggest that learning can help prolong problems and even stop it. This idea keeps me going!

I would like to no what others how have dementia think about learning new things. Do you enjoy it? Does it help? How do you cope on bad days, or do you not do it on them days? I think on my bad days I would just miss the day.. if that makes sense."
Memory cafe Three year Birthday,Norrms,2018-01-12T16:38:46+0000,0,"When I first walked into a memory cafe, many years ago now, I sat there for 15 mins, looked around and said ""This is not for me"" People were sat there, all in a square, which is no better than a circle, joined up tables and in front of them were children's 6 piece jigsaws, crayons and drawing paper. there was no music, no interaction and just a lot of folks sat there looking confused and very board. I was petrified that this is what I was facing at some point. Surely they all weren't like this? Surely there as more life in some memory cafes than this? Sadly, after visiting two more in different areas, they weren't that different, so I walked away, bemused and frustrated. it ate away at me for a long time. Later i did join a local one as a client/volunteer and tried to inject a bit of fun into it, a few songs and music, only to be told at a later date i wasn't a REDCOAT from Butlins !!! 

(I actually worked at Phwelli, Butlins in my youth bit wasn't going to argue the point LOL ) 

This is the point where we walked away, we were disillusioned but mot beaten!!

NOW ?? Here we stand, and tomorrow our very own Purple Angel memory cafe celebrates its THREE YEAR Birthday and all that is down to the determination and hard work by my loving wife, my very own ANGEL Elaine, it's her baby and we are all so very proud of her. She has been the driving force behind this, and she is the one who came home three years ago the last December and said 

I HAVE BOOKED A ROOM FOR OUR MEMORY CAFE, WE OPEN IN THREE WEEKS, SECOND WEEK IN JANUARY !! 

""I asked ""WHAT WITH ?? """" 

Elaine replied, ""Don't worry, I have it covered !! and she has ever since !! 

So tomorrow, we stand, as always, as a team, and celebrate with friends the third birthday of the Purple Angel memory cafe and our thoughts, of course, will be of those we have met and lost because of this awful illness, but of also all those we have yet to meet and hopefully help.

Thank you all In Torbay and indeed, around the WORLD for all your support

Learning Memory Skills,NotTooLate,2018-01-13T12:59:37+0000,0,"Some time ago I got an old course on memory called, Course in Memory and Concentration by Bruno Furst. It is really good. I then got another book called, Ageless Memory by Harry Lorayne. This is ok and lots of ideas are same. Wehn I am doing well I really enjoy trying to use the book ideas, but find a lot of time I can not use them. I was wondering if it is my problem that gives me the problems, or it would be the same if I did not have dementia!? 

I do enjoy doing the course so think it is worth it for that reason.

I wanted to know if anyone else with dementia, has had a go at improving there memory skills and how to remember? Would like to hear what you do?

I'm learning to do sudokus and find I am getting better and that gives me a good boost."

What is happening to me.,NotTooLate,2017-06-13T15:01:07+0100,0,"For many years I have had memory problems.

I have written notes to try and help me track it. Sorry it is long as being doing it a long time. 
first part is about me. next is about the things that are happening to me now.

Here are my notes... does anyone else no me?




From the time I started to know something was eating away at me, I started making notes.

I never used to think about me in the way I do now. Each day came and went, I planned and worked through the rolling days, all seemed fine, normal, as it should. Family life and work seamlessly merged and reasonable happiness was the result. Don’t get me wrong, there were the ups and down, but that is normal for everyone, that’s what makes it normal, but that’s the difference to now.

I’ve always had an average memory, average abilities, just an average me. I was a Primary School Teacher, had a lovely wife and four kids, home and a good social life… as I say an average person, living a good average life. However, I remember the first time something stopped me in my tracks and changed all this; this wasn’t anything that you would think would be a cause for concern, it was something I could rectify immediately, but it stunned me more than I can put into words. I got C and G mixed up!  Spellings one of those things, we all get stuck, but I couldn’t get it sorted in my head, the ability to think, or see what it should be, just wasn’t there. Was if C, or G!? It took several minutes and trying the different spellings, before it all became clear and the moment had gone.

This came back to haunt me and again and again. I got more letters mixed. b, d, p, t, m and n and on and on. More strange spelling problems started to appear. I started miss spelling words, like no and know, there and their, and I just didn’t see them. I would get letters the wrong way around in a word, such as wait and wiat, and again not see them. The most embarrassing was writing a good number of reports with the wrong gender… him when it should have been her and her when it should have been him; not good! I was having to get my work proof read. I was missing words, although to me the sentence read ok, I just didn’t see the problems. This had a major impact on my life. Reading a writing was becoming a mammoth task. Something that used to just flow, now took mind sapping effort. 

This started many years ago and kept asking doctors for help, but never managed to get, so this just went on; told stress of work, depression, possible virus! It has been something that gradually kept up on me and for twenty years or more I have had to manage.

In 99 I became ill, wet myself at school without knowing, became disorientated, had balance problems and finally ended up in QE Birmingham. Had test for many things, but couldn’t isolate the problem. 

The previous year, we had been on holiday in south of France, on the Dordogne River and while out I got a bite, or sting on my right leg. This led to a major allergic reaction. Had to have treatment, but several days later, I was up and about again. I wasn’t feeling 100%, but thought this was just normal.

My neurologist thought this may have had something to do with my illness, but then explained that this was like a, hit and run, accident, what had caused the injury, but the cause had now gone. I was diagnosed with left temporal lobe damage.

I lost the use of my right leg and much of my right arm and hand, facial palsy, loss of taste, smell, loss of bowl and bladder function, my eyesight, particularly my right eye was affected, I see a swirling pattern in front of my vision, everything moves. Diagnosed with Neuralgic Amyotrophy.

Treatment, care and time got me back to some normality. I spent a year in a rehabilitation centre and got brace which meant I was back in the land of the living.

The damage seems to be causing more problems and my neurologist said that it was progressive.

I started having seizures and was diagnosed with Epilepsy. Treatment has this under a lot of control.

Balance was becoming a problem. I would get moments were I would get the sensation of falling, as if I felt the whole weight of my body, a dead weight. This would be a split second thing, but would linger for several hours. These still impact me today, but now I’m predominantly in a wheelchair. I’ve never found anyone that experienced this sensation; like your body turns off.

I was stable till 2005 and then I had a major dizzy spell, although I say dizzy spell it really wasn’t a dizzy spell, it was as though my body continually wanted to fall to the right, over and over. Shortly after this I would get buzzing in my head and the pressure would build; it felt as if my head would explode and I would get this strange dizzy spell sensation. This left me on the floor, or if I was quick enough, lying down before I fell. Nausea was horrendous and I was unable to control being sick and messing my self; this is the worst feeling I’ve had.

This illness was different from the falling sensation that I experienced with the Epilepsy and was very different from any grand mal seizure, I didn’t know about it. Also, after a major event, I felt really good, high, euphoric  as though as I had been rebooted. Another strange thing about these events is that I’ve broken, fingers, wrist and had a few bad bumps, they didn’t worry me at all. I think I could have cut my arm off and I wouldn’t give a dam. I quite like these seizure, for these reasons and I sleep for ages.

However, these new head surging dizzy spells come on with a vengeance, the build of pressure in my head and the escalating buzzing in my head told me what was coming.  I was left for many days, in bed, unable to eat and trapped with the inability to move.

This was later diagnosed a Menieres and the medication took a long time to get right, but it seems to be well under control now.

With each event my hearing became worse and Tinnitus was, and still is, a major problem. I lost all the hearing in my right ear and much of my left. I had a Bone anchored hearing aid fitted and this has helped a lot. They would like me to have a cochlea implant, but it means I would loose any of my natural hearing that I have left. I can’t decide! 

Major muscle spasms and tremors give me great pain and I have daily morphin to help, which it does. I also have neuralgic pain, like toothache in my face, eye, teeth, ear and all down my right side, again Gabapentine helps greatly.

I was depressed, but what else would anyone expect and this had a major impact on my character, I was angry, frustrated and I couldn’t deal with anyone. This got so bad that my wife left me and my children started to keep away. Knowing what I was like didn’t help and doesn’t help now. I know I’m different, but knowing doesn’t stop it, it is out of my control.

I now live in a converted garage, that I rent. It is the garage of a teaching colleague of mine. They offered me the accommodation if I was happy to pay for the conversion to meet my needs. I have everything I need. I find getting out hard. I fear meeting people for there sake not mine. I have found that going out in my trike wheelchair helps, I can avoid everyone.

Finn, is my support dog, but he is more of a friend and I’ve had him for five years now.

I remember my grandad, not well, but can see him now, in a small room, in one of those places back in 1967. The room small. Just big enough for a single bed an wardrobe. I see him sitting there, on the bed, smoking his pipe. Not looking at me, dad, or out of the window, but at the blank wall in front of him. Slowly rocking like a lost gaged animal. He was a small man, plane. I can not here his voice, but I can still see him. Just the once, but I remember. He died alone and senile. 

Dad, mum said, died with the fairies.. we use to lafe at this, because we all remember him saying things that were off the wall, that was when he was not angry and ranting. ‘Send them my love and tell them yes’ this became his ending and repetitive catch phrase. Is this for me?




I have come back to write some more notes;

For a while I have been stable and able to manage my life. I like my independence, but over the last few years, I’m starting to have more problems, so I need to write the down, before I forgot.

I’m going to write them as they happen, the symptoms as I experience them,  so they may not make much sense, but I’ll try and clarify what is happening. I do not know if this will help me, but someone may make sense, someone may no what I am saying about. someone

1. I feel as if I’m getting smaller inside my head. There was a cartoon in the comic called Numskulls; this was about little characters that lived and controlled different parts of your body. The control centre was inside your head and the controller would look out of your eyes, so see the world from a distance. This is how I’m starting to see the world, from a distance, my hands, arms and feet, seem detached. Sometimes this is worse, but when normality is here, I do not have this sensation.

2. I get the sensation of travel sickness, like a nausea in the pit of my stomach. I can remember     being travel sick on a bus trip when I was at school and that is the feeling. However, with this I have this strange feeling of doom, I’m frightened, like something is coming. Feeling sick doesn’t last long, but fear feeling lingers.

3. My Mum and Dad passed away a long time ago, I’m not sure when, which is odd, but I get this feeling often that my Mum is next to me; over my right shoulder. I don’t see her as such, but I almost sense, or see her in the corner of my eye, a shadow.  I don’t hear her, although I do talk to her. I’m hoping this is normal. 

I often seem to get flashes of things passing my vision, but I have had this for a long time. As though something is scurrying across the floor, a spider, mouse. I know it’s not real, because I never see anything, but I always get caught out. The other type is almost like a movement in my peripheral vision, of an inkspot; like what you would see if you dropped a splash of ink into a bowl of water. I never see this in any detail, there here and gone just as quick.

4. Stopped driving. 
Starting off and slowing down started to become a conscious effort. Turning right, or left also becoming a problem, again something I didn’t really thing about now is something I have to consider. Times when out, suddenly total loss of where I am. Only short time, but totally no idea, everything seems unknown to me.  

5. I better at seeing words than trying to see them in my head. I get stuck with simple words, just can not see anything in my mind. predictive text helps with this. The other bit is missing words, so a sentence does read right. I still skim read, but find that hard to take it in.

6. Numbers in sequence. finding trying to work out what comes before or after, like what day with 12, 23 is.. can’t work it out simple. Same with which way to go when taking away or adding numbers. Not always a problem, but sometimes it’s a real problem.

7. I have two clocks to help me remember tablets and appointments, but I can not see the time will on the old clock as the digital clock. but I do get stuck sometimes with what time is coming with digital one.

8. Hearing sounds in distance, but strange memory sounds. We lived in Tamworth and Sunday the church bells would ring. I hear them every now and again… far away, but there.. Steam train at station, clicking of outdoor loo latch, it was big a metal and clattered. Voices chattering, but not making any sense, like the children in class, running water. I find sometime I find myself becoming aware of them for no reason. Doesn’t worry me, but is strange.

9. flat back of things I haven’t though about for a long time. I remember my first day at infants. The concrete steps, the pegs, and pictures, and going to sleep after dinner. Things are appearing as if pages in a book. There one minute. Same with smells and taste. Nice

10. Ghost over my grave. Get strange shiver feeling. Can get this days before going somewhere. If I get know something is coming up, appointment, or thought of going out. Days before.. waiting, fear.. face goes numb, affects swallowing.. have to think about it

11. Strange taste. This is unknown nasty taste. Metal mixed with burn toffee and raw meat. Not a taste I know. Makes me sick sometimes. Not know what brings it on.

12. Taste changing.. clear sweet or bitter. prefer bland porridge. 

13. Get stuck with swallowing sometimes. when I become aware of it. Like thinking of breathing. Sometimes I can not swallow and have to give up, but later no problem

14. Wake up gasping for air. Like stopped breathing. horrible sensation. 

15. Learning new things hard, impossible. I can not retain information, make notes but can not make sense of them. they do not lead me back to information. Used to play piano but can not remember sequences. 

16. Reading stories hard. Remembering what is gone before. if I story in one go that is ok. but if I come back to it. it doesn’t work. I listen more to stories, but find I end up just listening to conversation and miss story.

17.Like songs, seem to be able to remember them well. like singing, but not sure Finn does. Thinking of old songs more and more. make s me happy. good think

18. I’ve heard people talk of fog, my fog is like a pressure in my head, that seems to block everything else, I can’t think of anything clearly, can not plan, or what to plan. what to do, what I should do, when I should do thinks just getting more squashed out. Nothing is clear. The more I am aware of it the worse it gets and controls me. Not like falling into blackness, more like getting smaller and smaller inside my head, further and further away, so I can not quite make sense of the world. Out of reach out of mind.  Can think of what to do sometimes. Like moment of loss. This is the worse moments. Trying to grab hold of life. I know I should be doing something, or should have but what, how, when. feel like a light fading and getting dimer and dimer. 

19. know there is something eating my away from the inside, but if I know can I be ill? Want to fight, but feel I can’t. Terrified of what I will become inside my head. feel I’m being locked away. Don’t want to see you, but you not see me. How do I stop feeling hopeless.

20. Can type now. use to touch type, then noticed always selecting wrong letters. It was though my fingers had replanned, so when I thought one letter, I would select another. Not close letters on the keyboard, just wrong letters. Started one finger typing, but this is slow, like double checking each letter and still make wrong letters.

21. Forming letters. left and right. Keep getting shape of letter wrong. S starting the wrong way around, or tails like in g going wrong way, cross lines like in t, I put the wrong side. I can see it and know that it is wrong when doing it, but still have to work at correcting. I noticed this when had to copy picture test. Had problems working out which way lines go. It is left and right, up and down seems ok. Clock drawing was bad, I could see it was wrong and if I could have tried again, I think I would have got it right. I have to do things again and again. Hard to get image in head and make sense of it, even when looking at it. Can not make sense of it well.

22. Been working on memory training. Going over months. Ok now going through the from beginning, but hard when have to think what is after this month, what comes before. it is going backward and forward. Can do it but it takes time. Did not before.

23. My hair, beard and nails growing. Can not cut. It is not that I can not have cut them, but I do not want to. It is getting rid of something of me. Sounds mad to me I know. Like part of me. Broke nail and was really upset. Had to file nails. This helped as I did not see them go all at one time. 

24. Emotional get really upset by anything. TV advert about donkey. Bad foot and ******* making him work. I was just in bits. Can not control. Crying does clear me, I just get more angry and upset. Need some way to deal with this. Lingers 

25. Have mountain trike. Wheelchair with handles. Can get out. Like my own bubble. Finding can not stop. go around and around park. 1 mile and then just got worse. 5, 10 and last time 22 miles. I enjoy this, do not hurt anyone. Listen to music and just go. Could do with goal. Raise money for something. Would like to do long run.

26. Losing focus. I use to have a purpose to each day. Now no purpose. Just seem to day dream about nothing. Mind just skipping over nothing. need a goal. 

27. I have always been IT mad. Anything I would search online. Noticing that harding to rationalise my searching. Drifting. Harder to understand information. Takes time.

28. Use to run ukulele group. find playing songs harder. I no the songs, but getting body to go to right chords strange. I know it is wrong and can correct it, but seems to happen more and more. Like singing with playing. Focus on this and everything ok.

29. Like routine. I can do thinks once I get the routine. Problem when anything breaks it. Routine good for each day.  

30. Have watch that vibrates to tell me time of things to do. take tablets, wash, eat, people coming, everything is run by calendar. Feel it is running my life. Use to use diary when teaching. Whished I could do that now and not calendar on computer.

31. Thinking of brothers. Eddy had gone. I can not remember when. Like it was yesterday. Sad. got me down. bad day. Same with Mum and Dad. Feels so close, but remember at grave.

32. I become aware that I am going around in my room. Do not know why. Just suddenly aware. Feel like walking into nothingness. Nothing to hold onto. When did I start walking what started it of.

33. Notice big word problem. Like brain splitting word up, like when at school learning biger words. Not big problem, but words splitting. 

34. Days totally different. Good feel like I can climb mountain. Bad treacle everything hard slow just blacking. 

35. write emails, but have to write text over and over to make sure it is ok. This is the same when with anything I write now. But I can get there just takes time. Spell checker good. All the time words and grammar come up. but can work with that.

36.  Dreams and awake seem to be close. Sometimes wonder if dreaming. Dreams are always so bold and totally strange.

37. Been really aware of today. Now. Can not stop thinking of today. If I know now, will their be a day when I do not no? Fear of tomorrow. Here but not here. Feel like going down 2 road side of each other. Do not know which I am on. 

38. Feel like demon inside. fight my own thoughts every day. If I could stop fighting and deny them being there. would this help. Can not stop thinking of future. No good. Need to think now but how. I can not control this in my head. 

39. Say little as possible. ask me if I am ok. Say yes and smile. feel like being watched all the time. waiting to make problems. I have to work hard at what I am saying. If Barry says something, some of it is not there. I do not know what it is. I want to talk, but thing I will sound daft or just going on and on.

40. Alone, but never so lonely as now. Seem empty. Want a hug but no will cry. I need to cry but do not clear me. Could scream. miss love and being loved

41. Notice repeating myself. think I have done this all the time. Think we all do. But does not help remembering. when I stop I forget its gone.

42. Told have dementia, but can not get understanding of it. If I know I have problems how can I have it. Unspecified. what does it mean. Said 62 so early. Scan and test and family show it. This has been long road. Can remember start, just now get hazy. but is that me locking myself inside with it. Want to try anything. Said try anything. Do not want to sit and wait. Will I get a time when I do not no I have it. Feel like coin. one side dark the light. Everyone must fight it. rage against it. Do I take it and live without thinking of it. Would like that. If can have treatment, I would pay to try tablets. I have nothing to loss. If I have it ok, just leave me in peace.

43. I can not lateness. If someone is coming, they have to come on time. I panic, worry, stress get alsorts of things in my head. Knowing this doesn’t help. Waiting for the doctor, in an appointment, with others is a nightmare of heart beating pain. I get anguish days away before the time and it just gets worse.

44. I fear things that I did not before. I can get panic just by thinking of this. In Mri scan, I could stand it, could not go in. I feel my shoulders and that is it. I panic at the thought now. It the same for high things, small dark space, going out and the strangest is deep water. I do not go on deep water, but the thought of it is trigger to melt down.

45. Being sick a lot. Strange taste. metal or burnt metal. not when I eat, but after. Instant makes me sick. I struggle to eat, no swallow some times. Think this because fear of being sick after. Like neck want let the food go down.

DEMENTIA? our future is with our youth,Norrms,2018-01-10T16:35:59+0000,0,"OUR FUTURE IS OUR YOUNG ONES

Hi all, so proud to say I have just finished signing  41, yes that's........
FORTY-ONE!!
YOUNG PURPLE ANGEL AMBASSADORS CERTIFICATES ....................................

And will be presenting them very soon to the  1st Marldon Scouts and Cubs club Torquay.(permission was given to state this) 

(I am sure as I signed each one I grew an inch taller ?? )

Its a HUGELY proud moment for us doing this as we have always believed if we teach our children to accept the disease of Dementia for what it really is, just another disease and nothing to be scared of, then they will bring this with them in life, teach their children the same thing, in turn , reducing the stigma of it as we go through life.

We are very proud of these young people and IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY who you feel deserves the same recognition, please contact me

They have seen the light!,Jeanie 73,2018-01-08T16:52:10+0000,0,"Joy and I feel we have had a fruitful day today re Maggies visit from memory clinic. They have not come across PCA at the clinic although the consultant does know of it.
Joy gave Maggie a video too watch on her iPad and Maggie agreed that it described myself perfectly. We were both relieved plus I was able to show her how I can read the clock in my living room by looking at it sideways,but not looking at it face on.
Maggie was happy to give their memory test a miss today as I had a particularly bad sundowner last night and I was certainly not up to it!
I have often felt so alone knowing that my symptoms and how I am does not fit the Alzheimer’s on its own profile. She understands now the difference and agreed there is no point in seeing anyone else about it as there is nothing anyone can do about it other than continue taking what I am already on.
 I can only hope that our memory clinic will now learn more about it and it will help others, she did have to ask me who I should see if referred on and obviously did not know it would have to be a Neurologist, but then we are all on a very long learning curve!
She has been able too recommend somewhere where I can go for day relief sometimes and it sounds perfect for me.❤️❤️❤️"

I recently managed to see my wonderful Gp 'Dr W' who left our surgery and I was heartbroken as she was so brilliant.She was so helpful and supportive and is now temporarily a locum Gp at our surgery that we changed to when we moved house.  
Just before I got my book published I talked about my subcortical vascular dementia diagnosis. Although my symptoms remain the same as I haven't deteriorated she now wonders if my illness is stroke related. It made me feel as though I had been a bit of a fraud being on this thread. Irrespective of what the diagnosis might be I have lived under the cosh and stigma of dementia and have all the emotional baggage that goes with it and the insight of having memory loss, as well as caring for a friend with early onset Alzheimer's. I so want to use this experience to benefit others. I still have cognitive impairment and will continue to support the Alzheimers Society!"

I have had swallowing problems for a while,but tonight it has been worse than usual in fact most things seem to be getting worse much quicker than what was usual.
My bowel difficulty, I seem to get on top of it and then the meds don’t work as well as they did.
I adjust and just cope best I can.
Sight wise the same,but more about spacial awareness really.
Memory also although I am still very aware of what is going on, I don’t see many people so listen to the radio quite a bit,but I am no longer recognising what were familiar voices, ie David Attenborough is the latest this week!
The reason I possibly seem a little blasé perhaps too some, is simply because I will be 78 next February so have been more accepting maybe than someone much younger since my diagnosis 4yrs ago and I am physically quite disabled, but I use a wheelchair to garden and it’s been my daughter and my garden that have kept me going.
EBIXA has been a godsend, not easy to begin with,but now feel I am going back those 4yrs to how I was and worse now! There is nothing else I can take!
I go to memory clinic after Christmas and afraid they may take me off it if they think it’s no longer working!
On the whole I have not been afraid and told myself I would take stock after Christmas so trying too hang on for a bit longer.
I must add that I have remained around my 30/40s in my head and simply don’t think in the way many people of my age do! And don’t intend to start now.
I am though someone who needs to know what’s ahead and will cope best I can what ever the problem may be,but now quite frightened of what is ahead❤️"

Speech for this weeks conference,Norrms,2017-12-18T09:14:40+0000,0,"On the Wednesday, 20th December 2017 i am keynote speaker at a huge conference in Torquay, this is my speech, hope it helps you all so much, please leave comments, and let’s make 2018 the YEAR WE SPOKE THE TRUTH ABOUT DEMENTIA

The conference is called
UNDERSTANDING DEMENTIA,
so here goes…

I have dementia, IT’S THE worst thing I can ever imagine anybody having, yes there are other illnesses out there and just as awful, but today we are talking about this one.
What’s worse than having dementia? KNOWING you have dementia!! And with Lewy Body’s, sometimes, this is the case!! As in my case, I have dementia and I know I have dementia,
I suffer terribly from Sundowning, not every day, but some days, I get worse as the day goes on, I do some weird and wonderful things whilst I am Sundowning, I shout, I scream, I dance in the street, I hallucinate, I talk and see people that you don’t, I will not say that isn’t there because in my world they are!! I fight and thrash about every night putting my wife and loved ones in danger, I run around the room wide awake at three o clock in the morning, hallucinating, chasing murderers and fighting those who wish to harm my family, and then ?????
I wake up in the morning, get up and do this???? I talk to people about dementia and look (TO THEM, that is ) as if though there is nothing wrong with me ??
Then, and this is one of the worst things, ITS B****Y dementia that decides what you remember from the night before, and not you!! It’s like you have no free will of your own!! You suddenly start to remember some of the things you did the day before, you feel ill you are so embarrassed, and then you feel sick!! Why?? Because there is a good chance you’re going to do something very similar again and again and you have no control over it!! Can YOU imagine that?? Having no control of some things you do??
Total Chaos I call it, I refuse to call it total madness because it’s such a grey area, Is dementia a mental health condition?? In my humble opinion? No its not, because mental health conditions can be cured, this cannot, this is terminal, I am terminally ILL I am going to die from this or something related to it PERIOD!!
This is dementia as it really is
Does that sound normal to you ??? Can YOU imagine living this kind of life every day ??
That’s just the tip of the iceberg there’s a long way down to go yet.

Confidence??

I stand in front of you today, hopefully, articulate and well expressed, but how do I know this, is this dementia playing another trick on my mind, am I really here?? or is this just another one of my fantasy’s, how do I know what’s real these days and what’s not ?? I sit there sometimes, at home and wonder what’s going on, wonder how I even got to this stage. You will notice this with some of your patients and residents; sometimes they go really quiet and subdued, into their own world. Well, when I do this? I think of days gone by, of how hard I worked to feed the family, the struggles we had to make ends meet, so we could look forward to a happy and very long retirement, only to find myself in this state, wondering if people really believe what I say, seeing the look in their eyes when I act daft, thinking AWWWW Poor thing look at him, Thing is I have ALWAYS ACTED DAFT!! I LIKE ACTING DAFT!! It’s not my dementia?? ITS ME!! The real me having a good time, and sometimes making people smile, it’s not an act, it’s not dementia it’s me for Goodness sake having FUN !!
TRUE STORY When i was first diagnosed and when my Dr said You have dementia, do you know what Elaine’s first words were to him ??
How do you know he has dementia????? he is always and has always been like this!!!
(Thanks Elaine LOL)
PLEASE Try and remember who I was before dementia, and who I am now, I am still the same person, I just have a disease of the brain !! I am ILL just like anybody else
Then, there are the comments I get, and you wouldn’t believe some of them??
the most common one is
You don’t look like you have dementia ??
WHAT ???
What the H*LL am I supposed to look like??
And one of the strangest ones is
You don’t SOUND LIKE you have dementia??
Well, unless someone has invented a language just for people with dementia and haven’t told me, I have no idea what that’s supposed to mean??
But beware; there is a new kid on the block!! People have said to me three times now in less than a month,
“You present yourself very well”
But they’re not kidding me, oh no ??, I may have dementia but I am not stupid!! It means the same thing so please don’t be fooled by the new wording.

Wellbeing

This is probably the hardest one to talk about, not just because I am a man, but because it involves cleanliness and little accidents as they call it, you wanted to truth ?? here it is .
People with dementia have accidents, they wet themselves, they soil themselves, they do NOT do it to wind you up, they do NOT Do it on purpose and they don’t DO it to order !! Its nothing you have said or done, it’s not your fault, but it certainly isn’t their fault either, Shouting at them, cussing them, calling them names because of it is nothing short of verbal abuse !!The signal that tells the brain that they have had a wee or a poo has been lost somewhere, they have no idea what happened, It’s NOT THEIR FAULT, THING IS !! they can still smell what happened, they can still feel the wetness, their sense of smell hasn’t disappeared or their sight, they look down and can see what happened !! They can feel the dampness on their legs when it cools and how uncomfortable it is regarding the other. Then there’s the embarrassment of being cleaned up, washed and made to smell ok again, take a second and imagine if this was you who had to be cleaned up, what would you feel like !!
Not nice is it? They may have dementia, but they still have feelings, they still get embarrassed, just like you and i would, dementia hasn’t taken all that away.

Independence

Let’s take a minute to think about this ?? What would you call Independence ?? Free will, living where we live? Free speech etc ?? your probably right on all counts, but for me ?? Do you know what i call independence ?? Do you know what i miss most of all ??

Walking to the corner shop ON MY OWN for a paper and a pint of milk on my own !! Yes on my own, i cant because of my Spatial awareness, because i cant cross a road by myself or I will get knocked down as i forget to look both ways, Everywhere i go i have to have someone with me, never any ALONE Time for me ever again, or me time again for me, never again to sit and chill on your own, in an empty house, or walk across the moors yourself working out lifes reasons, imagine that,
imagine if that was you, how would YOU Feel ??
So, where does that leave us ?? You wanted to to understand a little more about dementia, and i hope you do now, but it that it ?? Do we just leave it there ?? Or do we try and do something about it?
2018, as far as i am concerned is the “” YEAR of the TRUTH ABOUT DEMENTIA! “”

We have come so far in the last ten years, but not far enough, we are still hiding behind the shadows of dementias cloak and frightened to talk about the things that most important, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT After diagnosis, it wouldn’t happen with ANY OTHER Disseise!!
How many people had realized how bad dementia really was, and more importantly
How many people, had been told about ANY of this when their loved one was diagnosed??
Just what are the GP`s , Gods, err sorry Consultants LOL, Psychiatric nurses thinking about ?? Do we not deserve to know the WHOLE TRUTH about dementia ?? WHY would you hold back such important information ?? if you get diagnosed with cancer, or heart problems, you get follow up after follow up appointment , someone is with you at every step of the way!! Not just get a phone call, if you’re lucky, about once every 12months for goodness sake .. THIS HAS TO STOP !! SOMETHING HAS TO BE WORKED OUT AND QUICK !!

Why does it all have to be blamed on the F WORD (Funding) funding all the time, why cant volunteers of ALL organizations to work together, educate each other so they can be there for all when someone gets diagnosed, people like us DON’T WANT PAYING !! WE WANT TO HELP< Please LET US HELP< Kick whatever politics you think you have out of the front door and start to open up to each other, SHARE INFORMATION, for Gods sake its not a state secret, you can find anything on Google these days, but that’s not as good as a real person, sitting you down, holding your hand or drying your tears, i am sorry but it's not!! We have PROVED with the Global Purple Angel campaign almost ANYTHING is possible!! And with VERY VERY LITTLE MONEY and NO WAGE BILL!! Believe me, if we can do it, with Myself at the helm, anybody can!! YOU Can help, YOU CAH HELP every day of every week of every year, and its so simple to do so, just by changing things slightly to what you are doing now. Sundowning is one of the worst things that can happen as we have just discussed, so how can you help with that? Well, is so simple !! Change all the times of the appointments of your loved ones /clients residents to a morning appointment, it really is as simple as that, no matter who they are seeing, a dr, a dentist a hairdresser Psychiatrist?? it doesn’t matter, but if you change their appointments to the morning, they will feel better, your job will be easier and who they are going visiting will understand them a lot better, SIMPLES REALLY I will finish off with this “ I DON’T CARE if I cant remember yesterday|” “ As long as Today os ok, that’s ok then !! ” End"
I DONT ??????,Norrms,2017-12-14T08:20:58+0000,0,"I DONT.......................


I don't get angry, I get frustrated,

I don't mean to shout, I want to be heard,

I don't mean to walk like I am drunk, I just can see properly,

I don't want to keep repeating myself,

I don't want to keep having ""Little Accidents"" so embarrassing,

I don't want to see things that others cant see

I don't want to be frightened to death

I don't want to scream and shout every night,

I don't want to hurt you when I am fighting in my sleep,

New diagnosis,Sailor Tom,2017-12-09T13:12:45+0000,0,Hi my name Tom am 55 years old and diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's the end of last month .It was a big shock for myself and family we are slowly coming to term's with it .and working out where to go for help and support
Imagine ??,Norrms,2017-12-11T09:54:54+0000,0,"IMAGINE ??
Imagine having a dream last night that you were floating above the earth from a parachute looking down on earth`s green lush landscape when suddenly there is a CRACK!! You start to freefall and see the chute above floating away, you plummet to the ground, the panic runs through your veins as the ground rushes towards you.
You start to scream but just as you do you hit the ground with a sickening thud!! All goes black for a millisecond and everything is silent. That is, until the pain sets in, the pain all over your body screams as if it's on fire, you try to move but it's useless. As you look down as what WAS your legs there is just a bloody mess, as you try to crawl away, screaming your loved one's name over and over again.

Then you awake !!!! With your loved one trying to calm you down, holding onto you for dear life and you shake uncontrollably trying to make sense of what just happened, wondering if it will help to talk about it, worrying about the time of night and how so very tired your loved one look in the middle of the night when he or she needs that sleep to wash away yesterday`s horrors.

The morning arrives and the night terror is just as real, just as vivid in your mind, your eyes tell the story over and over again as you look in the bathroom mirror, wide eyes, full of fright, and the day hasn't even started properly yet.

How would you cope? What would you do to try and forget the night terror that haunts you for hours in the coming day? What do you say to people when they ask how you are and all the memories come`s rushing back from the night before, the slightest sounds makes you jump out of your skin.
Just try to IMAGINE IF this was YOU ?????

This was my night last night and is my morning today my friends, this is the honest truth of how NIGHT TERRORS affect someone with dementia.  this is about as honest as it gets, i don't write this to scare people, i write it to try and explain what loved ones might be going through, i hope it helps

"All you wanted to know, but THEY were to afraid to tell you",Norrms,2017-12-06T08:49:20+0000,0,"TIME TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT DEMENTIA………PART TWO ……………
Things YOU always wanted to know, or SHOULD know about dementia, but THEY were too AFRAID to TELL YOU
Following my post of last week called,
Time to tell the truth about Dementia
Which had over 300 comments in less than an hour worldwide
I, and i am sure many others were horrified around the world to learn that THIS information is not being given out, this is
“” MY ANSWER TO THEM “”
Those with dementia MAY, and I have to STRESS, “” MAY “” show some of these symptoms
1. Confusion and repeated questions are very common, please remember they are not doing this to ” “” WIND YOU UP ” Every time they ask the question it is the very first time they have asked it, according to them.
2. Swearing and Anger, even though they may have never have sworn in their life, they have heard people swear many many times during their lifetime, they know the words and are very familiar with them, so don’t be so shocked, this may be a form of release because their inhibitions have changed.
3. Inhibitions, talking of which, some may start to walk around completely naked in front of others with no conscience whatsoever, they may also start to speak their mind and say exactly what they are thinking and feeling. They may be a lot sharper in tone, than usual, lose their temper so quickly, all born out of frustration.
4. Violence, a very tricky one but has to be spoken about, even the mildest mannered of people MAY lash out at loved ones and strangers at times, they may bite, scratch, nip punch, spit at you, kick out or worse, please remember it’s not them, but the disease.
5. Incontinence, believe it or not SO MANY Drs etc DO NOT talk about this when giving a diagnosis, yes it does happen to all, but to those it does, it has a HUGE effect on everyday life. Always starts with small accidents, small damp patches etc and increases. Please remember the signal from the Bowel./ the bladder has been disrupted and cant tell the brain when they need to pee or poo. In all honesty, if they KNEW what was happening they would be MORTIFIED as would you, SO NO NEED TO CHASTISE AT ALL !!
6. Frustration, Imagine KNOWING you have this disease as in Lewy bodies, and KNOWING there is no cure, no remedies, and the chance is, you will forget ALL that you hold dear but you can do absolutely NOTHING about it. ?? Wanting to scream and shout is a huge understatement and why it often happens for no apparent reason.
7, Speech, the loss of coherent speech is so familiar in some people with dementia, one of the most common is having a conversation with you that make s absolutely no sense whatsoever to you, but please remember, it does to them, and please also REMEBER THIS, if you listen to them very carefully, sometimes, just sometimes you will hear the word “Thirsty” “Hungry” or “Painful ” repeated. This could help you understand a little more.
8, OUTBURSTS, A very important one, this can be caused by noise, or life, in general, being so busy around them, supermarkets shops etc, the volume of peoples voices is sometimes magnified a thousand times to people with dementia so its sounds absolutely deafening causing the person with dementia to shout SHUTUP !! Or worse !! Sometimes causing them to RUN out of the shop and try and escape to only they know where.
9 Wandering, The MOST important thing to remember is, people with dementia never ever get lost!!! THEY know EXACTLY where they are going!! They just haven’t told you !!! They will often try all sorts of tricks to get out of the house, and please don’t be fooled into thinking because of their age or frailty they cant get far. NO ONE KNOWS where they get the strength from to walk such distances but they can, and please dont forget they have bus passes and can use them. We had a lady from Torbay who was found in Scunthorpe thanks to her bus pass, never EVER underestimate those with dementia.
10 Hallucinations, Hallucinations are NOT DREAMS or NIGHT TERRORS lets get that out of the way first.
Hallucinations are usually connected with those who have Lewy Body, but people with Alzheimer’s and particularly vascular dementia because of lack of oxygen to the brain will, or may suffer from these (I will NOT apologise for using the word suffering because if anybody has them like i myself do believe me they are suffering!!) Day or night these can happen, it may, to you, liker they are talking to thermselves or wanting to chase pepole, in some cases they will kick and punch as if shadow boxing, you will not be able to see who they are doing this to? But believe me, it is so VERY REAL To them.
11, NIGHT TERRORS, Imagine your worst fear being played out right in front of your eyes, imagine the horror unfolding in front of you, piercing screams, grotesque faces and being`s, clawing at you, biting you, then multiply this by 100,000 !!! and you have a night Terror. Also, imagine not being able to wake from this as it seems neverending.
Then imagine this happening every 30 mins of every night of every week?? Hard i know but this is how bad it can get.
12. Feelings. This is a tough one, but i have seen with my very own eyes the hurt it brings when you may visit a loved one and they are holding hands, or have arms wrapped around a complete stranger in a care setting and don’t recognize you. You may well have been with this person a LIFETIME but please beware, this happens more regularly than some places care to admit.
13. Spatial awareness Is the person stumbling? Staggering like they are drunk for no apparent reason? Do the FALL “Upstairs” or downstair`s? Banging their toes on doors, beds etc? Are they missing the step down on the pavement, or more importantly walking into the road with no fear of oncoming Traffic?? This is because what you see they don’t, once again the signal from the eyes to the brain is distorted and wavey, this cause to see things very differently and miss the most important bits, very similar to having blind spots for all you drivers out there.
14 LOSS of APPETITE ?? or NOT ?? because of that signal (ONCE AGAIN) to the brain from the stomach and eye`s not working properly some with Dementia may want to eat more as they have forgotten they have just had their meal. “What if they eat a lot? i hear you cry? “They must feel full I hear you say” but HOW can they feel full if the signals not working and they still feel starving ?? So you see, not their fault, they are not at fault at all because of this awful disease.Then there is the quandry of those not eating or drinking enough. this can be caused by many things but sometimes it really is just a case of putting water into a yellow cup or container, placing a small meal on a yellow plate instead of white and doing the same with tea and coffee.People with dementia can sometimes see right through clear glasses and don’t see whats in front of them, we have p[roof this works on our other website
15. Sundowning !!! And LAST but Certainly not LEAST? SUNDOWNING !! I would personally put this on the school curriculum if i had the chance !! Sundowning is easier to understand than you think, it does exactly what it says on the tin !! AS the sun goes down the person with dementia gets worse, becomes more confused, more agitated and more frustrated, it really is as simple as that !! And what is, even more, simpler to help you and others including professionals, is to, QUITE SIMPLY change all their appointments with Drs, dentist, podiatrists , consultants etc, to MORNING Appointments so the person with dementia is in a better place, its a lots easier on you to manage and the Drs etc don’t have a hard time treating then either, you see? its not that difficult is it ??
These are just 15 points of what you MAY come to expect after a diagnosis of dementia, WHY don’t they tell you this ? and WHY has it taken so long to be told this? especially by a person who is LIVING with this disease ?? I have NO IDEA !!
But what i do hope is you all read this, share this, copy and paste this and print it out and put it in every Drs surgery in the UK /World for all to see, it’s not a state secret, and those who don’t want to know won’t read it
Very best wishes, Norrms Mc Namara (Diagnosed with dementia 9 years ago and trying to help)"
Frontal Lobe Dementia - Recent Changes and No Support,Decaff,2017-11-23T01:50:15+0000,0,"I was diagnosed last year with Frontal Lobe Dementia by my psychiatrist during a hospitalisation for bipolar.
I am 64 yrs old and live alone with no f..amily here in Scotland and am not close to any of those living in England.

I have had very little support or input from anyone since my diagnosis.  Recently my language has become very aggressive and intemperate - shouting and swearing through a closed window a parked cars outside my home for example. Today I threw a tub of chocolate desert and a milkshake at a wall while swearing at my CPN as I stomped off to lock myself in the toilet and refused to talk to her or come out until she'd gone. Childish I know but I was really angry with her.

Nobody talks about my diagnosis, offers me any input or even seems to monitor how it is progressing.

My recent change really worries me. My personal hygiene started deteriorating a couple of years ago.  At least now if I don't shower daily I use baby wipes and deodorant.

What am I supposed to do?  Any suggestions."

LAST NIGHT (LEWY BODY`S),Norrms,2017-11-24T07:54:24+0000,0,"Called Quite Simply.......................
""LAST NIGHT""
In darkened hours when all is still,
The lonesome hours you beg to fill,
The blackened night is all around,
Until dawn arrives without a sound,
You long to see the dawns pure light,
After such a hate-filled crushing night,
Awakening every hour with screams,
Never understanding what it means,
For mornings light you pray to come,
So your night of Terror is over and done
Then somewhere, in the emerging light,
You hear the sound of the birds first flight,
Their song erupts from the gloom,
You night of terror will be over soon

Hi all..... Brokenhearted new member,Clare bear,2017-11-25T11:36:47+0000,0,"Hi all, I've had symptoms for about 5 years and diagnosed about 8 months ago. I've just been told by my husband that that he can't cope, not so much now as I have medication which has really helped but his fears are that he can't cope in the future.

What do you think of the book cover?,creativesarah,2017-11-17T17:43:04+0000,0,"I am getting nearer to self-publishing my first book of short stories, called 'The Memory Box'
Hopefully it will be available on Amazon the first week in Dec I will let you know when it goes live.
I am a bit undecided about the cover design but I have attached 2 possibles and would be very grateful for feedback.
I want the book to be able to given to people with cognitive impairment without it pushing the fact that it has them in mind. I won't mention in the cover blurb dementia or MCI. I want them to feel its just a nice read although the stories have slight references to memory loss.
I cant think of a suitable sub-title other than 'A passionate pursuit of memories'
Does it need a sub-title?
Can you think of a better one?
Honesty will be appreciated.
The paperback will be printed with a slightly larger font than usual and wider spacing as a friend of mine with Alz recommended that.
Feeling a mixture of emotion, from severe crisis of confidence, to unexplaiable joy.
Please feel free to ask any questions
Many Thanks Sarah"

Global Purple |Angel Dementia campaign is 4 years old TODAY
This is just """"""SOME"""""" of what we have achieved, with more to come very soon I hope (Fingers Crossed ) apologies to those I have missed, and please share and i will be posting this on the 16th Nov 2017 as well
On the 16th November 2013 at The Palace Hotel with Laurence Kelly’s help, the first 50 Purple Angels were welcomed, some traveling miles to be there on the day and with fabulous Skype links to other countries!
Over the last 4 years, we have seen a huge amount of people joining us at Purple Angel. Admiral and dementia nurses as ambassadors care home managers, rock stars, people with dementia and carers, former carers who wish to raise awareness, Councillors, mayors, authors, teachers, and trainers. MPs and gerontologists, walking groups, Dementia Coalitions, Purple Angel Ponies and the wonderful USA Hospital Wristband project spreading to other hospitals. Funeral Care and many other businesses throughout the world taking part. We have seen Dementia advocates join together with people raising awareness in high streets, WI; U3A; Rotary Clubs; and other organizations. School children being educated and books explaining dementia both for adults and children. One young ambassador takes pride of place with Kid Caregivers! We have Memory Cafes established throughout the world.
Renowned people with dementia speaking up, blogs; radio shows; a dementia-friendly cruise; campsites; ambulance service and police; dementia friendly barber and dementia friendly restaurants.
Now in 55 countries around the world with over 750 ambassadors worldwide and more being added every day.
Dementia Aware on Facebook with nearly 21,000 members all supporting each other. A visit by Prince Edward to a Purple Angel memory cafe TORQUAY.
Not to mention all the high street shops and businesses from the USA to Australia now proudly displaying the PA logo and the many people involved with caring for people with dementia who are taking support from just knowing that the purple guardian angel is looking out for them.
Police stations all over South Devon display the Purple Angel logo and have read all the info as do every Stagecoach bus in the south west of the UK
We have people helping with families giving companionship's and mentoring even karaoke! We have bloggers and radio shows taking place. A forward for a film made in Norway. Another film has been shown and presented to the Sundance Festival called ""NORRMS "". We have a new care guide incorporating much of the work of an Oxford ambassador. Purple Angel ambassadors joining together and in some cases actually meeting up. All hard working and non- profit, raising awareness because they care.
From the heart of the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina through to North Colorado throughout the USA and Canada then over to Nigeria and South Africa, on to Australia, Germany, France, Ireland, New Zealand; Nepal; Bangladesh; Nepal; Sri Lanka; France; Singapore; Zimbabwe; Romania; Slovenia; Indonesia, China and many more.
Represented at regional and international conferences and connecting communities with other projects such as Christmas dinners, care home entertainment and drop in centers.
Hospice workers and global research advocates, pharmacies and churches have all become involved. We include activity coordinators and were even represented once at a care expo in China and at regional and international conferences too. Supported by ADI and many other Dementia organizations,
Not forgetting the HUGLEY POPULAR World Rocks Against Dementia ""WRAD"" now officially in its third year and growing globally every year !!
And YET ??The Purple Angel campaign is, unbelievably only 4 years old!
and if it wasn't for Jane Moore doing a doodle of a purple Angel in the very beginning ??
Well, it doesn't bear thinking about xxx

DEMENTIA-ISOLATION + Benefit of the Doubt,Norrms,2017-10-17T10:09:23+0100,0,"Dementia-Isolation + Benefit of the Doubt


Hiya all, this might not sit right with some, and for that I apologise, but here goes anyway as I have always spoken from the heart.

In any illness isolation is an awful thing, but with dementia even more so, because over time, and as the disease progresses a person with dementia becomes more and more isolated, and sadly, sometimes, this comes from those around you. I am not talking about those closest to you doing things for you as has been mentioned before, but in general day to day living and decision making. If i am honest there are times i could scream because i am being corrected so many times by others. Not only that, when i am corrected about something i know i am 100% sure of is right, i get that knowing look, that nod, and the weakness in their necks where their head bends to one side and they are thinking Ahhh, must be his dementia SO INFURIATING !!

SOMETIME`s WE GET IT RIGHT""!!!

All too often people, including loved ones are so quick to jump to the conclusion that it cant be right ! because we have dementia, can you imagine how limiting that is, how it feels like not be heard, and even worse, how it feels like not to be believed, 

WE HAVE DEMENTIA, WE ARE NOT STUPID !!

All i am asking, and this is from personal experience, is please think about what you are going to say first, but most of all please listen to what we are saying and give us the benefit of the doubt as you would to others, please don't take away our voice, our opinion and our very own self-worth

As I walk through the street, I am there, yet I am not,
You see me, even hear me, yet I don't see you
I am not in your world, I am NOT  in my own world,
I am in dementia`s world where nothing is real,
YOU are not, THANKFULLY
I stand and stare at the shop windows, but I don't see me,
Sometimes I see a younger me, sometimes an older me,
But I NEVER SEE ME, never  the REAL ME,
You hear me speak, but sometimes I don't hear you, 
I want to hear you, I want to hang on to every word,
I want this world to make sense again,
But of course, it doesn't, not anymore,
I see where your going, but I don't know where I am going,
I hear you laughing, and yet I cannot laugh,
Dementias world is devoid of all sense, humour, and direction,
I walk in a maze of uncertainty and loneliness,
Each step is so hard some days,
Each step feels like a mile walked,
I stumble and stagger as if walking over rough terrain,
Sometimes falling over absolutely nothing,  in a heap on the floor, in a heap of embarrassment,
Never wanting to get up again, hoping dementia`s world will swallow me up,
Sometimes I am here, sometimes not,

Gulp - something new,creativesarah,2017-10-11T22:25:20+0100,0,"Tomorrow is my first attempt at taking the creative writing group I go to, as a tutor.
I am feeling very nervous but my aim is to eventually start a creative writing group for those affected by dementia. My tutor is full of hope about it!
I found a wonderful quote by Helen Keller about memory
'Smell is a potent wizard that transports you across thousands of miles and all the years you have lived.'
I have got some things to smell like Germolene, perfume, citrus bath oil.
I am going to put some items on the table and then get people to write as if they are that object and I have got some facsimile newspapers which are fascinating.

I have just ordered a new Alzheimer's Society T-shirt as I have been asked to do a reading of one of my stories at a fundraising event, and a wristband and a brooch.

In this months 'Living with Dementia' my poem was shortlisted so lots of exciting things going on despite going through a very difficult time

Chins up!"
Update on my book -needing a bit of feedback,creativesarah,2017-09-28T21:33:02+0100,0,"I am still enjoying writing my book and a friend is mentoring me and making sure I keep at it!

I want it to be empowering and encouraging. I have got 9 - 10 stories that fit 1&2 and I want to publish this first
.
I am planning to self-publish the first book and if necessary I may crowdfund for the second if I don't manage to get a publisher

I want people to feel they are on a journey not that they have reached their final destination.
Early on when first diagnosed it can feel as if you are staring into a black hole but that is when you need help and hope to go on and live life to the fullest that is possible in your situation

I'm not sure what emphasis I should go for

1 a book of short stories that address memory/dementia issues in a narrative rather than clinical way
 this may be a story about someone with early-stage enjoying life as well as they can, that we are on a         journey, not a final destination and aims to help those newly diagnosed and their carers and family but is 

2  a book of short stories that can be enjoyed by anyone, but with memory as the theme including reference to some memory loss in a few of the stories.

3 a book of short stories that will inspire carers to try new activities with the person living with dementia but some of these stories depict the person with dementia in later stages as well as early. (I think this may be my second book)

Any feedback would be appreciated as I want to help as many people as possible

I would like to publish as an ebook and a paperback. I wouldn't mention dementia in 1 & 2 as it would make a nice gift and some people might not want to read it if it was labeled in that way

I  want to use a larger font and 1.5 spacing to make it easier to read

It will probably be called the Memory Box so that it is searchable online in a dementia context.

Thanks for reading all this."

As I walked through Newton Abbot yesterday I felt my legs getting heavier, but the most disturbing thing was my head was getting even heavier. they talk about the weight of the world being on your shoulders but this now applied to my head. it felt as if I couldn't lift it and was being pressed down by some incredible invisible force, my eyes were glued to watching my feet as I struggled to put one foot in front of the other. Elaine noticed straight away, held onto me and insisted that was enough and we headed back to the car. I hadn't walked that far but I had felt a little ""Strange "" most of the day. By the time I got back to the car I was totally exhausted, shaking and so out of breath, my head felt like it was full of cotton wool and I couldn't get my words out properly,

 Lewy Body`s had struck early in the day.................

Unfortunately, it didn't come by itself, accompanying it was what I call my ""Concrete Overcoat"" Some people call it the "" Big Black Dog, most know it as depression. I was being assaulted, mentally and physically from all sides, as you all know, I also have heart failure and have so much trouble breathing sometimes, yesterday, as they day, felt like the ""Perfect Storm"" 

Not much was said on the way back from Newton Abbot to Torquay, about a twenty-minute journey, don't get me wrong, it wasn't for the want of trying !! But hard as I tried, just a mumbled jumped up set of words came out that even Elaine couldn't understand. I literally staggered out of the car as if I had been drinking as Elaine held onto me as tight as possible as we approached our flat. As soon, as I got in she, sat me down, took off my shoes and helped me to bed ""best place for you  at the moment i can recall her saying as I fell into a black depressive sleep, which was fitful and littered with disturbing dreams and even more disturbing and dark ridden thoughts.

 An hour or so later I awoke with a thumping head and feeling very disorientated, so very low and couldn't see any light what so ever at the end of this everlasting tunnel called dementia and depression. I firmly believe the two are inexplicably linked and when they come together, all seems lost. The rest of the night was sat in almost silence and I am so grateful it was, because my ANGEL Elaine just has that knack of saying the right things at the right times, when to say something and when not to, bedtime came and as it did I dreaded, once again what was to come

I have been so fortunate to experience many wonderful things and activities during my life and i am so grateful for this. I just want to express such things with my friends on here which you might identify with.  I also hope our cares pick up our threads.

Did they not know that I had a high powered job in industry?

Did they not know that i trained  as a counsellor and worked  in the community with those who had problems with addiction?

Did they not know that I was a musician and performed in venues throughout the Uk and Europe?

Did they not know that I went to university in my fifties?

Did they not know that i met then married wonderful lady?

Did they not know that I am a stepfather to a smashing young man?

Did they not know that I am a grandfather to a beautiful little girl?

I think i have said enough.  I really hope this thread douse not sound that i am boasting.  I would not have accomplished much of what i have done without individual and collective efforts of others

Navy blue or black?,Jeanie 73,2017-09-08T12:52:42+0100,0,"Well we managed to get into town for a couple of hours yesterday. Having too change and adapt to how I am for now, rest earlier even though probably only been awake a relatively short while and then go out!
I can't get through the tiredness other wise.
Brain overactive because I've been out so no sleep until 1am.
Bought a long cardigan a while back, wanted a black one, both Joy and person who served me said it is black,but too me it looked navy blue! Wore it yesterday still looked navy blue to me! But when I put my new specs on hallelujah it was black.
My Optician knew of and understood about the PCA so he was not surprised when they did the test with the dots that move and you have to say how many etc. That I could not do it so I have non existent peripheral sight and he stated that I would need adjustments re my specs over time. He is aware that PCA is neurological, but it seems that he is able too adjust my sight in some way too compensate for a while anyway.
Afraid I don't understand any of it and Memory clinic have not got back to me,but because Maggie did not know about PCA I stated that I was on correct treatment anyway, they probably thought there was no point in seeing a neurologist. I'm inclined to agree!❤️"

Is there a solution? Other than just talk too yourself?,Jeanie 73,2017-08-09T12:35:27+0100,0,"I don't really know where to start, but start I must! What is really there for me in my every day life?
I must first say that I am in no way sorry for myself in spite of the Alzheimer's and now the P.C.A I would be far more concerned if it were one of my children that was affected.
I am so grateful for the love and care that I get from my daughter, but I have no one to talk to other than Joy, I can no longer cope with the phone.
The highlight of my life is if I can manage to go to the toilet once or if I'm lucky twice a week! Something most of you don't really want too know I'm sure, but Alzheimer's is not just about memory, it affects also all your bodily functionality and add in the P.C.A that also affects your sight,but in a quite insidious way by distorting what you can see some times in a frightening way and the truth is the part of your brain that enables you too see is dying and with no known timeline.
The good news, for me anyway, is that generally it allows you too retain much of your thought process, and you can still empathise with others and understand them. Speech is a different matter, so is trying to hand write anything or add up numbers or just deal with numbers in any meaningful way.
My predictive txt writes almost all of this for me now,otherwise it would just be a load of rubbish making no sense at all.
The memory clinic people are very kind see me once every six months mainly too see if I can still stay on the Ebixa. They say just call them if any problems!
At my age most of my friends have either died or have some kind of Dementia themselves any relatives live a long way away. A sad fact of life I'm afraid  
I'm quite good at being on my own, but it would be nice now and then too have someone to talk to and with. Not about the disease but I have many interests and would be interested also in theirs. My speech may be slow and I forget what I want too say,but often get there in the end!
Is there a solution surely there must be, mus,not there!?❤️"

What about the Carers ??,Norrms,2017-08-21T08:39:23+0100,0,"What about The Carers ???

As I was getting dressed this morning my darling Angel Elaine wrapped her arms around me from the back and said ""Not one of your better nights, or weeks actually"" I knew then it has been a bad week, but what I didn't know, or remember, was how bad the previous night had been. I feel I should have done but I didn't see the usual dark shadows under her beautiful eyes and felt so sad I had missed this. Sometimes this is the worst part of it, most of the time I CANT remember what happened the night before, in fact, I remember very little and what I do, I share with you all.

Sometimes Elaine shares with me and I share with you but most of the time she doesn't, for fear of upsetting me. This is where the guilt comes in, I can see the tiredness in her eyes, I can hear how she yawns during the day and I can hear the weariness in her voice and yet ?? And yet she doesn't share all for fear of upsetting me ?? So many times I have wept in private after watching her in the evening and during her daily struggle with exhaustion but never once has she complained, not once.

I am writing this in the hope that those people who are not touched by dementia or have never become a carer, out of necessity, or choice, understand just a little better what carer`s go through. Yes, it's us with dementia who have the illness, But the carers? Please just stop and think about them for a while, please ????

Keys to remembering the past,Norrms,2017-07-23T16:59:14+0100,0,"KEYS TO REMEMBERING THE PAST ??


As i finished taking the garden rubbish around the back i sat on my patio and went to put my keys back into my pocket after locking the gate. As i sat down i looked at my keys and was so very surprised to see how many keys were actually on my key ring. So, i stared at them, counted them, of which there were many and hard as i thought i realised, apart from all but three keys i have no memory of what they were for ??? The three keys i could remember where my front door key, my Patio door key and my key for fishing (yes it's true, this saddo has a key for fishing lol, it opens gates to various venues where i fish ) but the others brought back no memories. 

Now, this may not seem such a big thing to most people, but to myself, living with this awful disease of dementia it was huge !! WHY ?? because in the palm of my hand were possibly, so many different memories lay, so many different experiences that could tell so many tales? 

THE GOLD ONE ???

Was that a special one because it was GOLD? What door did that open ?? i knew i was a manager of a huge retail Store, could it be one that used to open that? What tales may that tell if it were? Years of working with so many people but no memory of many of them now.

The silver ones?

Maybe there were keys to old houses where we used to live, Elaine my darling wife is forever pointing out around Torbay where we used to live when we first moved here, but alas, those memories are long gone, feeling so sad now. 

The small ones????


These have to be keys to sheds, they are too small to be anything else, Oh how i wish i could remember the SHED TIMES, i am a keen gardener even now so i just know i must have had so MANY HAPPY memories pottering about in my sheds, feeling really upset now........................

So, what do i do now? the thought of these keys and the memories they must hold is making me very sad as i can't remember them, So, do i cast them away and think well, they only make me sad when i look at them? OR ? Do i hang on to them and hang on to the hope that one day there will be a cure and those memories will return to be loved, laughed at and cherished ??? 



I think i will KEEP them for the time being !!!  Keys are COOL .......................

Wrong Diagnosis ?,Norrms,2017-07-11T09:57:43+0100,0,"I personally believe that many many people out there are diagnosed with Alzheimer's type dementia when they actually have Lewy bodys dementia, its just easier for some Drs to class it as the most common one (Allegedly)  Thing is some drugs for Alzheimer`s disease can be quite wrong for those Lewy Bodys

SO? QUESTION ??

These are some of the symptoms of Lewy Bodys, Sound familiar ????  

Symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies include:


Changes in thinking and reasoning
Confusion and alertness that varies significantly from one time of day to another or from one day to the next
Parkinson's symptoms, such as a hunched posture, balance problems and rigid muscles
Visual hallucinations
Delusions
Trouble interpreting visual information
Acting out dreams, sometimes violently, a problem known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder
Malfunctions of the ""automatic"" (autonomic) nervous system
Memory loss that may be significant but less prominent than in Alzheimer's

Shadows that dance,Norrms,2017-07-21T08:33:29+0100,0,"The Shadows that dance

The other day whilst in a shop with Elaine i was feeling very uneasy as if i was being watched, sometimes this happens, my eyes start to dart from side to side and i feel as if my heads on a swivel as if seem to be watching out for a possible attacker. The fear you feel sometimes when you have dementia like me, stems, i think,  from the fear of the unknown, the future, what MAY lie ahead, or not. To suddenly feel petrified for no apparent reason is not uncommon and happens more often to the likes of me that people often realise.


At this point, the noise level goes off the charts and your hearing becomes acuter. It's as if you can hear every conversation going on around you but its all just jumbled up words, sounds and echoes, it gets louder and louder as it races towards a crescendo of who knows where, then it happened, the blackness moved in..........................................


I saw something move beneath my feet ever so quickly from side to side, something black, so foreboding and worrying. I jumped to one side and yet it seemed to follow me just as quick, i jumped again but once again it moved with me, my mind couldn't take in what was happening. then the blackness moves away and all was gone, i turned around to see where, and it was then i realised it was only a shadow of someone stood nearby as i browsed the bookshelves, but OH how all seemed so very different just a few second before.


How i HATE this disease and the tricks it plays on your mind when you least expect it, but i hope this short article explains some of the things we go through with this awful disease.

Yay I am home alone and happy to be so, it would be wonderful if a friend were to call in and say hi.
Joy will be on her way too York, hope the weather stays fine for both of us. For now it's a new chapter in the journey that is Alzheimer's and is proving too be a better time, we both have always adapted over the years too mainly not so good changes, but we must make the most of better times.
Home is where I feel most comfortable and not afraid, simply because it's so familiar and it is home  and whilst it is so familiar and safe it may not always be like that as the Alzheimer's progresses. For now it's great❤️❤️"

Getting back to my confusion.  I could not remember how to open the micro wave door.  I could not access a pay point because I tried to put my card in the wrong place.( I tried to put my card in the flashing light instead of below it)   I could not remember how to empty the dishwasher  There were several other instances where I have forgot to mention

My wife has also mentioned my irritation in these times of confusion and low mood.  I do not like myself for that

I just feel that I am spiralling down and I am only 63.  In fairness such a feeling might because I feel low.  I am sorry that i can not end this post with a more positive way.

Not going too think any further than that of it! For now I find I have to stay as calm as possible. For instance I was getting really annoyed at all the starlings swooping down to grab all the mealworms I had put out for the smaller birds, within minutes my eyesight became distorted and hazey my insides feel so shaken and yet outwardly know one would guess or know.
I can't comprehend what it must be like to not be able to voice how you are to anyone else! And yet I am beginning to wish that I know and comprehend far less than I actually do know and feel.❤️

Raw side of lewy bodys dementia,Norrms,2017-06-15T16:58:48+0100,0,"THE RAW SIDE OF LEWY BODY`S DEMENTIA


Have you ever woken up such a feeling of dread you are convinced the worst thing that could possibly happen to you has happened or is going to do anytime now?

Have you EVER loved someone so much it hurts at times and the thought of them hurting breaks you in two ?

Or, ? When you feel as if you have had such a wonderful happy trouble free day and feel like nothing in the world can harm you and any memory of Lewy bodys dementia or any other illness seems in the distant past??

Then, please, if you can try  imagining coming out of a hallucination in the pitch dark in the middle of the night with arms flaying, Punch after punch being thrown  legs kicking and the love of your life screaming STOP STOP ITS ME !!!!

ITS DEVASTATING. ITS PETRIFYING. IT`S SO UNIMAGINABLY  FRIGHTENING.

You know then LEWY BODY`S Dementia demon HAS BEEN TO VISIT

You try to get off back to sleep, but its not a real sleep, its a fitful one full of flash backs and worry, you try sleep facing the other way from your loved one but the feeling of it happening again never wanes and stays with you all night.

When you get up the feeling of guilt overwhelms you as you try, in vain to make sense of what has just happened, but , of course you cant, all you can do is look at your loved one and hold them as close and as tight as you dare, they say its ok, they say they are not hurt, they SAY you missed every time ???

But did i ????  Would they tell you if hadn't ??

It carries on during the day, the flashbacks, the sounds, the screams from the night before echoing in your ears as if its happening all over again. You Jump, startled, and yet nothing is  there. It eats away at your confidence and ability to function during the day, your nerves are shredded whilst all the time this heavy feeling of guilt lays across your whole body.

And then comes the worry if it happening again, until suddenly you ask the question you have never imagining asking yourself ?? 

WHAT IF ????? WHAT IF ????  OMG !!!!!!  WHAT IF ???

Tears start to flow down your face as the sheer thought of hurting someone you have adored forever stats to hit home, you begin to shake with fear, you feel sick, your stomach turns and tuns until you are almost physically sick , the seat starts to roll down your face and you just know you have never felt so helpless in your entire life.

And then ?? EVEN THEN !! Your loved one holds you, kisses your cheek as you keep repeating time and time again that your so sorry, you hold each other as if the world is going to end right there and then and wait, together, as the tears subside on both faces.

But you both know, so very deep down  that the chances are very real of it happening again and again, and next time ???????????


THIS IS THE REALTY OF LIVING WITH LEWY BODYS in its very RAW state , no apologies, but really hope it helps more that upset`s

Much love and please feel free to share/ copy and paste

I have started writing short stories and poetry and I am finding it helpful.

I don't want to share my whole poem as I won't then be able to enter it into

The love of it's protector
Has placed him there
Not to stifle and constrain
But to heal and redeem
Saved from a captivity 
Of misunderstanding,
Rejection,sorrow.

My lovely friend J has seriously deteriorated to the point where he has become violent and I can no longer safely have him over for meals or take him out.
I feel such a grief about this and it has weighed me down.

Sometimes we are like caged birds but I intend  to sing and I know he will too, in his own way. The real J is still there just broken. I hope if I can bring healing in anyway that I will find the strength to do it."

Nightmares and Night terrors?,Jeanie 73,2017-05-15T20:19:57+0100,0,"Last night I had a nightmare unlike a night terror where I did not know or understand exactly what it was I was afraid of, only that I was terrified.
The last real nightmare I had was before I was put on the Ebixa, I no longer able too remember what it was about, but I can remember how I felt i.e. Could not move a limb but then a darkness descending and an acceptance that this was the end just before it went totally black.
Each time I was surprised too find myself actually waking up and checking too see if I was where I thought I was, I was, but afraid to close my eyes.
Sometimes my little dog sleeps with me,but I remember I was restless so had put him back in his bed. 
The content of the nightmare was that I didn't recognise my daughter a complete stranger stood in front of me, I asked if she was a friend of Joys and yet deep down I knew it was Joy. I won't go into the scarier bits of the nightmare, but when I did wake up properly I wondered if I would recognise her when she did come down! Needless too say I did, but I know that one day I might not.
If nothing else it made me feel so grateful too be where I am in a decent home with family, daughter and granddaughter close by and my garden that I can see and watch the birds we feed come and go with their babies now in tow. 
Hopefully it will be quite a while before the next nightmare, or perhaps there simply won't be any more❤️

""Last night i had a good nights sleep "" I cant remember the last time i wrote that. The horrors of Lewy bodys and all it entails seems incessant and never ending at times, the night terrors, the hallucinations the continuous streams of distorted faces flashing in front of your eyes jarring every bone in your body, and then, as if ""FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY""  Nothing !! 

As i awoke this morning all around felt different and yet familiar, it was very similar to travelling back in time to a place i once knew, a happy place of safety and security. Just for one  nano second i was FREE, Free of this awful disease of dementia and i have to say it was the most wonderful place to be, if just for one second. My first words to Elaine were "" Did you sleep ok ?  As many a morning i had thought i had a good night only to be told it had been awful and i just couldnt remember it and as Elaine said yes we both had a puzzled yet contented look on our faces.

i know times like this dont come along that often as i said, but i am so very grateful as the rested look on Elaine's face and the Tired lines around her eyes that little smaller was a joy to see. I write so often about the kind of nights i have as well as daylight hours, but times like this gives one hope, it gives a person with dementia that much needed lift , if only for a short while when all is well with the world. Please dont get me wrong, i am a realist and i know from much experience that its quite probably the only time it could happen for however long, but the fact is , IT HAPPENED !!  

And the fact that it did may mean it could happen again, and for that, as a person living with this awful disease, its give me hope, the strength to carry on and the ability to function a little better, if just for one short precious time

I felt like it was my first day at infant school crying for my mum to come back.
My support worker suggested this place as it has more activities than the previous one I had tried.
There were mixed ages and mixed abilities but a good proportion of people who were still articulate even though they had Altzimers for years.
An easel was set up for me to have a go at painting which I loved although lost some skills it was still fun.
People were talking about anything and everything and I was so at home .

Care In The Community - Whos fault is it ?,Norrms,2017-04-28T16:15:40+0100,0,"Care in the Community in a ""Critical state""
But who`s fault is it ??


I recently did a talk / presentation to a dedicated hard working bunch of carers a few days ago and it was ALL my privilege to do so. My presentations are actually more about listening to what others have to say rather than me talking all the time, and unfortunately what i did hear was quite disturbing. The fact of the matter is the Home care Industry in the UK is on its KNEES , the carers who work for the companies are overwhelmed, underpaid and understaffed and under trained.

So whats new ?? I hear you say, and i dont blame you !! But the thing is this, (In my own humble opinion) for so long we have been actually blaming each other and others, but whom is really to blame? The Government? The town councils? The local CCgs or the Care Companies themselves 

This is what i was told yesterday by incredibly hard working carers.........

Some companies ask the carers to actually PAY for their own training

Some companies do NOT pay carers for the time they do any training 

The most they get is ONE DAYS TRAINING 

and the most shocking news for me was when i suggested that some carers could do a free dementia course online to improve their skills the person in charge of training laughed and said

 YEA RIGHT , like they would do it for nothing ???? putting the carers down

In sport we have a saying, if you do not want to pull the shirt on and be proud to wear it, then dont play for the club!!

In other words, if you dont want to be a paid carer, and i must stress a  PAID  carer`s as a lot of people didnt choose to become a carer but because of loved ones illness`s they have to  and THANK GOD they do.

But if you dont want to be a a paid carer, learn as much as you can and be a better person for it as you will be helping others live a better life, then, quite simply dont do it!!

So now we have those left who DO want to be a dedicated carer, just as nurses want to look after people in hospital, those who are willing to go the extra mile and who we ALL rely on, they are without a doubt the backbone of this country who along with unpaid carers keep the economy afloat because if they all didnt do what they do this countries infrastructure would collapse, make no mistake about that, so where do we go from here.

We know their is no money about, we know the companies blame the CCG`s and the town councils who in turn blame the government who is in power at the time, its always about Funding and wages, and staffing, but its doesn't have to be. i am not looking at this with rose tinted glasses on either,, my GOD my own wife only gets 4 hours respite from me every week, hardly a drop in the ocean, but what i am talking about is self worth and Care company bosses getting their act together and training these carers to the highest standards so they can justifiably turn around the the ccgs and Town councils and say we have Highly trained carers in our company who have all sorts of qualifications now behind them so deserve better rates of pay and should be on par with nursing staff ect as they are looking after human beings as well.

THEY WILL THEN HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP

The care home owners and care providers have to take responsibility in the first place and start the ball rolling. As an ex manager (Albeit in retail)  i believed that if you invested in your staff, the ones who WANTED to be become better at what they do the rewards would be immeasurable. You have to show you have FAITH in your staff, you have hopes for your staff and give them the right encouragement , help and advice that is warranted, if you do this, your company becomes more efficient, less costly as sick days drop and also a huge improvement for the quality of care care for the people you look after happens.

This is not something that can be worked out as a mathematical possibility, or decided in an office way up in the sky far far away from the real people on the ground, but can be achieved by sitting with care workers, listening to them and asking THEM how YOU Could improve their working lives which doesn't include huge pay rises or having to pay for their own training , (Still cant quite believe this actually|) 

There is so much help out there that can be downloaded for free, given out to carers, and read by many which would help. their are UNI courses that are absolutely FREE to take and are rewarded by recognised worldwide accreditation.

In my HUMBLE OPINION, its YOUR FAULT we are where we are , all you bosses and care providers (OWNERS) that dont invest the time and right training in your staff will always have problems, its certainly not the carers fault!!  If you employ people on a two arms, two legs, anybody will do basis you will always have a very high turn over of staff, BUT !! if you have FAITH in your staff, train them to a respectable level and reward accordingly then YOU have something substantial to take the the local CCG and town councils when you are asking for more funding!! 

The days of blaming each other and the government at the time is very old hat!!  Also the days of employing a ""Anybody will do "" option should be outlawed.

The other option, in these days of Direct payments is for YOU carers out there to go private, on your own, and then you can ask £12/14 an hour,(  nearly half more of what you probably earn now) and earn a decent wage for a while instead of the local council paying the care providers £15 /16 per hour +and you only getting the minimal wage. 

NOW THAT would make the care providers sit up and take notice wouldn't it ????

If it's any use to anyone - power of attorney.,danonwheels,2017-04-19T12:16:57+0100,0,"I receive an email every week or so from the money saving expert website and I've jsut had details of how to get a power of attorney at reduced cost:

Power of Attorney, more important than a will & now it's CHEAPER
Everyone OF EVERY AGE who's got assets, consider protecting your family and yourself from costs and shocks

Die will-less and you don't choose where your assets go - not good. Yet if you lose your faculties, whether due to stroke, accident or dementia, without a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), your assets could be locked down - even stopping your family paying for your care. It's not an age thing either: I'm 44 and have one. Every grown-up with assets should consider an LPA, but most don't. I make no apology for pushing, especially now the cost's dropped. See Power of Attorney, but in brief...

Power of attorneyRelatives can't just access your cash if you lose your faculties, not even to pay for your care or mortgage. One person develops dementia every 3 minutes, others lose capacity in a variety of ways. It's often quick. And when your family are already under stress dealing with your condition, without an LPA, the only way to take charge of your finances is via the Court of Protection. People often say that's a nightmare, as Judith tweeted: ""@MartinSLewis Took 12mths to go via Court of Protection for my mum. Cost £3,000.""

With an LPA you nominate a trusted friend/relative to take control of your assets ONLY if you lose capacity. It's a bit like an insurance policy in case the worst happens.

Power of Attorney cost cut to £82. The cost of registering an LPA in England & Wales has just dropped from £110 to £82 - the Govt wants to encourage more people to take this step. In Scotland it remains at £75, in Northern Ireland £115. If you've simple circumstances and know what you're doing, you can DIY it online.

New. £79 Which? Power of Attorney drafting codes. An LPA is a legal document and the DIY route can be tricky. The gold standard is to get one drafted via a solicitor, which can cost up to £500. Which? has a halfway house - you fill in a questionnaire & the LPA is populated, then checked by a paralegal. Which? normally charges £139, but we've blagged Which? codes to get it for £79 until Wed 31 May. (You'll still need to pay the Govt registration fee.)

Sort future medical care & your (living) will. I've focused on the financial LPA, but you can also set up a health & welfare Power of Attorney to give loved ones authority over your treatment, and a living will (officially 'an advance decision'), where you can refuse certain medical treatments if you lose capacity in future. Plus, while you're at it, consider making a will if you don't have one."
A different kind of help needed,shelagh,2017-04-18T12:43:53+0100,0,"Hello everyone, I was diagnosed with Alzheimers seven years ago and for the last five years I have been campaigning hard for the Alzheimers Society.

where do I find a draft?,creativesarah,2017-04-13T15:27:53+0100,0,In the middle of posting I got disturbed and lost my post
Sunrise/sunset,Haverton,2017-04-12T17:55:38+0100,0,"I have had a bad today.  I just accept that.  But the day and all it's troubles can close at sunset.  As the sun arises tomorrow I feel invited to enjoy what a new day has to offer. It might be good which is great if not once again the day will close at sunset.

On this forum the wonderful members have taught me to live well with dementia,a concept I really struggled with for sometime.  I now enjoy several activities where hitherto I could not manage.  At the moment I can refuse to let dementia define who I am as a person.  I am going to hang on this mantra as long as I can.  Presently I have several roles to play.  I am a husband, stepfather,grandfather who may make a contribution to their happiness, wellbeing and a host of other things that are beyond my imagination.

Take care."

Diagnosed last week,Justchillin,2017-03-28T22:06:22+0100,0,"I was diagnosed with dementia last Friday, given a test result of 81 out of Hundred?  What's this really mean, I'm 68year old male. I knew somethings wrong about 4 years ago, but only odd memory loss then, thing have slowly but steadily getting more and more regular.  I've not had anything in writing yet, will they tell me what type dementia or do I have to ask?Does everybody diagnosed have to contact help themselves,  I just feel abandoned already. It took 6months to get to this point, now what?"
Lying to PwD,danonwheels,2017-03-15T10:52:00+0000,0,"Hi all,

I love the way this forum is set out with the headings as they are - I have dementia/I care for a person with dementia etc etc

I am a person living with dementia, and am very young at just 40 (though my stupid brains seems to insist that I'm 37) and my alzheimers at the moment is very mild.

Just out of interest I sometimes take a look in the carers forums and read throughy some of the threads there.  I even replied to one yesterdayu as it dealt with something I have experience of.

What I have noticed over the past few months is that there are a lot of people lying to their family members with dementia of all types.  This makes me sad.

Also reading about what is likely to come ahead for me is upsetting and saddening, and quitre scary.

I can't help woindering if even at my early stage my partner and friends sometimes lie to me - I'm sure I have caught my partner in a lie from time to time about silly little stuff and this seems to be particularly when I'm confused about something.

Is there a reason for the lying?  Is it just easier for the carers or something?  And does anytone think about whether the PwD is aware that they are being lied to and how they might feel about that?

Sorry this probably isn't coming across too well.  I'm not accusing anyone or trying to upset or offend anyone, it's just something that bugs me."

WRAD 2017 Gets approval from Prime Minister Theresa May,Norrms,2017-03-16T13:34:22+0000,0,"Here is a letter i received this morning from Theresa May,  Prime Minster of the UK giving her full support for World Rocks against dementia 2017, yesterday i received one from former PM David Cameron"
After the long winter,Jeanie 73,2017-03-11T15:31:34+0000,0,"I wanted to share my thoughts now spring is almost here.

Having time too simply watch nature at work the last few weeks has been amazing. Despite some bitterly cold weather plants and birds get on with announcing that spring is on its way.
It's pretty obvious that it's little too do with the weather, but it's all to do with the lighter days,the length of the days!
The cold may hold back the opening of some of the daffodils for instance although even that is due to type as well. From the first almost imperceptible tiny buds on shrubs and trees that all continue too grow despite it being bitterly cold, birds also continue too collect nesting materials having already chosen their mate.
Being in quite a built up area it is my garden that keeps me relatively sane!!!  
I can no longer watch most TV drama's I get lost in complicated plots that twist and turn and make my head spin, but quietly watching nature at work I can Take it all in [emoji173][emoji173][emoji173][emoji173][emoji57]
It's difficult I know, but there's a saying 'take the time to smell the roses' or in this case the daffodils and all that is spring.

Not that PIP again!,Haverton,2017-03-13T13:48:11+0000,0,"What a traumatic morning my wife and me had to endure.  My wife presently receives  the full rates in terms of care and mobility in the former DLA of witch she had been awarded for life.  She suffers with a chronic headache condition where the pain level is so acute she can't function on any level.  Although her situation never change she may not meet the criteria where PIP  can be awarded. I can't begin to say how this assessment has had on my anxiety - it has gone through the roof and in turn had an affect on my overall wellbeing.  Mostly because our income will be so compromised.  I find it so difficult to concentrate and do the things i normally do.  My recent posts have been so upbeat but how things  can change in so little of time.

Sorry about this rant but I need to unload in a secure place that  this forum offers"
